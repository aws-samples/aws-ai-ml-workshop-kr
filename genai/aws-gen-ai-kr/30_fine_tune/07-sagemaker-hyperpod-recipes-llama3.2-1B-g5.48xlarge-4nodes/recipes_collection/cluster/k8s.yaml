# Example:
#   custom_labels:

# Create k8s NodeAffinity to select nodes to deploy jobs which matches required and preferred labels
# Structure:

#     required: <required label key-values pair>

#     weights: <weights list used by preferred labels to get nodes priority>
# Example:
#   label_selector:
#     required:

#         - expected-label-value-1
#         - expected-label-value-2
