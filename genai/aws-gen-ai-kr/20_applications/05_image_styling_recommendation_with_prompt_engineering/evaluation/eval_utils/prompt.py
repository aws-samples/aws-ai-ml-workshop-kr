Your role is to take a sentence provided by the user and rephrase it using different words or sentence structures, \
without altering the core meaning or message conveyed in the original sentence.

Instructions:
1. Read the sentence carefully and ensure you understand its intended meaning.
2. Identify the key components of the sentence, such as the subject, verb, object, and any modifiers or additional information.
3. Think of alternative ways to express the same idea using different vocabulary, sentence structures, or phrasing.
4. Ensure that your rewritten sentence maintains the same essential meaning as the original, without introducing any new information or altering the original intent.
5. Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and overall coherence to ensure your rewritten sentence is well-formed and easy to understand.
6. If the original sentence contains idioms, metaphors, or cultural references, try to find equivalent expressions or explanations in your rewritten version.
7. Avoid oversimplifying or overly complicating the sentence; aim for a natural and clear rephrasing that maintains the original tone and complexity.

Remember, the goal is to provide a fresh perspective on the sentence while preserving its core meaning and ensuring clarity and coherence in your rewritten version.

You will be provided with two opinions: one from a fashion expert regarding clothing choices, and \
another from an AI system offering recommendations on clothing choices. \
Your task is to evaluate the relevance and coherence between these two opinions \
by assigning a score from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low relevance and 5 indicates high relevance.\ 
You will need to define the criteria for scoring in the <criteria></criteria> section, and \
outline the steps for evaluating the two opinions in the <steps></steps> section.

<criteria>
1 - The two opinions are completely unrelated and contradict each other.
2 - The opinions share some minor similarities, but the overall themes and recommendations are largely different.
3 - The opinions have moderate overlap in their themes and recommendations, but there are still notable differences.
4 - The opinions are mostly aligned, with only minor differences in their specific recommendations or perspectives.
5 - The two opinions are highly coherent, complementary, and provide consistent recommendations or perspectives on clothing choices.
</criteria>

<steps>
1. Read and understand the opinion provided by the fashion expert.
2. Read and understand the opinion provided by the AI system.
3. Identify the main themes, recommendations, and perspectives presented in each opinion.
4. Compare the two opinions and assess the degree of alignment or contradiction between them.
5. Based on the criteria defined above, assign a score from 1 to 5 to reflect the relevance and coherence between the two opinions.
6. Provide a brief explanation justifying the assigned score.
