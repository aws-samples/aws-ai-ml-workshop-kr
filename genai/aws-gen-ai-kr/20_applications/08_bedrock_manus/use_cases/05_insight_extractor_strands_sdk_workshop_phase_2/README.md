> Amazon Bedrock-Optimized AI Automation Framework

Bedrock-Manus is an AI automation framework optimized for Amazon Bedrock and business use cases.

> Come From Open Source, Back to Open Source

Bedrock-Manus is based on the open-source project [LangManus](https://github.com/Darwin-lfl/langmanus).

## Demo Video

> **Task**: I would like to analyze Amazon product sales data. The target for analysis is the './data/Amazon_Sale_Report.csv' file. Please conduct an analysis to extract marketing insights based on this data. Please perform various analytical techniques starting from basic data attribute exploration, product sales trends, variable relationships, variable combinations, etc. If there are any additional analyses needed to extract insights after the data analysis, please perform those as well. Please include detailed analysis in the report along with supporting images and charts. Please save the final report in PDF format.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: UV Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ai-ml-workshop-kr.git
cd aws-ai-ml-workshop-kr/genai/aws-gen-ai-kr/20_applications/08_bedrock_manus/use_cases/05_insight_extractor_strands_sdk_workshop_phase_2/

# Create UV environment (automatically creates symlinks in root)
cd setup/
./create-uv-env.sh bedrock-manus-agentcore 3.12

# Run the project (from root directory)
cd ..
uv run python main.py
```

### Option 2: Traditional Conda Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ai-ml-workshop-kr.git
cd aws-ai-ml-workshop-kr/genai/aws-gen-ai-kr/20_applications/08_bedrock_manus/use_cases/05_insight_extractor_strands_sdk_agentcore/

# Create and activate virtual environment
cd setup/
./create_conda_virtual_env.sh bedrock-manus-agentcore 3.12

# Run the project
cd setup/
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run from root directory
python main.py 
```

## UI (Application)

## Architecture

Bedrock-Manus implements a hierarchical multi-agent system where a supervisor coordinates specialized agents to accomplish complex tasks:

![Bedrock-Manus Architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

The system consists of the following agents working together:

1. **Coordinator** - The entry point that handles initial interactions and routes tasks
2. **Planner** - Analyzes tasks and creates execution strategies
3. **Supervisor** - Oversees and manages the execution of other agents
5. **Coder** - Handles code generation and modifications
7. **Reporter** - Generates reports and summaries of the workflow results

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- ü§ñ **LLM Integration**
    - Support for all models provided in Amazon Bedrock (Nova, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, etc.)
    - Multi-tier LLM system for different task complexities

### Development Features
- üêç **Python Integration**
    - Built-in Python REPL
    - Code execution environment

### Workflow Management
- üìä **Visualization and Control**
    - Planning based on TODO list
    - Workflow graph visualization
    - Multi-agent orchestration
    - Task delegation and monitoring

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- This code has been tested in the environments listed below.
    - Amazon SageMaker AI Studio (CodeEditor and JypyterLab)

### Installation

Bedrock-Manus leverages `UV` for fast and reliable dependency management.
Follow the steps below to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Step 1: Create UV environment (automatically installs dependencies and creates symlinks)
cd setup/
./create-uv-env.sh bedrock-manus-agentcore 3.12

# Step 2: Run from root directory
cd ..
uv run python main.py
```

By completing these steps, you'll ensure your environment is properly configured with UV and ready for development. The script automatically creates symlinks in the root directory, allowing you to run `uv run` commands from the project root.

## Usage

### Basic Execution

To run Bedrock-Manus with default settings:

```bash
python main.py
```
or use `main.ipynb`

To run Bedrock-Manus with UI (Streamlit):
```bash
cd app/
streamlit run app.py
```

### Advanced Configuration

Bedrock-Manus can be customized through various configuration files in the `src/config` directory:
- `agents.py`: Modify team composition, agent system prompts, and `prompt caching` enablement

### Agent Prompts System

Bedrock-Manus uses a sophisticated prompting system in the `src/prompts` directory to define agent behaviors and responsibilities:

#### Core Agent Roles

- **Supervisor ([`src/prompts/supervisor.md`](src/prompts/supervisor.md))**: Coordinates the team and delegates tasks by analyzing requests and determining which specialist should handle them. Makes decisions about task completion and workflow transitions.

- **Planner ([`src/prompts/planner.md`](src/prompts/file_manager.md))**: Plan and Execute tasks using a team of specialized agents to achieve the desired outcome.

- **Coder ([`src/prompts/coder.md`](src/prompts/coder.md))**: Professional software engineer role focused on Python and bash scripting. Handles:
    - Python code execution and analysis
    - Shell command execution
    - Technical problem-solving and implementation

- **Reporter ([`src/prompts/reporter.md`](src/prompts/coder.md))**: Professional reporter responsible for writing clear, comprehensive reports based ONLY on provided information and verifiable facts.
    - Summary imtermideate results
    - Python code execution (results generation)
    - Shell command execution (results generation)

#### Prompt System Architecture

The prompts system uses a template engine ([`src/prompts/template.py`](src/prompts/template.py)) that:
- Loads role-specific markdown templates
- Handles variable substitution (e.g., current time, team member information)
- Formats system prompts for each agent

Each agent's prompt is defined in a separate markdown file, making it easy to modify behavior and responsibilities without changing the underlying code.
