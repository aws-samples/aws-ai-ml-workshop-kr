## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Choose the right template** based on your agent type and complexity:
   - Simple single-purpose agents → Template 1 (Minimal)
   - Standard production agents → Template 2 (Standard)
   - Multi-agent systems → Template 3 (Advanced)
   - Specialized roles → Templates 4-7

2. **Replace all placeholders** in square brackets `[like this]` with your specific content

3. **Remove sections** that don't apply to your use case

4. **Add sections** if your agent needs additional guidance not covered by the template

5. **Follow the hybrid format** (Markdown headers + XML tags) for consistency

6. **Iterate based on testing** - start minimal, add complexity only as needed

7. **Validate** using the checklist in the main SKILL.md file

## Customization Tips

- **Keep it minimal**: Start with fewer sections and add only what testing reveals is needed
- **Be specific**: Replace generic placeholders with concrete, actionable guidance
- **Test early**: Deploy a minimal version and iterate based on actual performance
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't add every possible section "just in case"
- **Maintain consistency**: Use the same structural patterns across related agents
