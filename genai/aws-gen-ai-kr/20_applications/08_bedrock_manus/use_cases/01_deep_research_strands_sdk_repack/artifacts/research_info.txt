URL: https://tdwi.org/articles/2024/12/18/ta-all-whats-ahead-in-generative-ai-in-2025-part-one.aspx
Content: "TDWI research also shows that the generative AI application experience will grow more multimodal. In 2025 and beyond, multimodal LLMs will proliferate as developers create more generative AI apps that work with text, image, video, audio, and other data modalities. In the recent TDWI survey on achieving success with modern analytics, 46% of enterprises report either using generative AI text prompting now to generate images and other modalities or plan to do so over the next few years. Adoption of generative AI will accelerate across business and consumer markets in 2025 and beyond. Already, generative AI features are becoming a key differentiator in enterprise applications in the form of conversational user interfaces, embedded digital assistants, natural-language chatbots, task-oriented copilots, and other large language model (LLM)-powered productivity augmentations. Prediction #3: More Sophisticated Platforms and Tools - Generative AI will be a principal driver in the evolution of enterprise data foundations in 2025. Demand for multimodal applications of generative AI will drive evolution of enterprise data lakes, data pipelines, data governance, and much more. Likewise, adoption of generative AI will bring such platforms and tools as vector databases, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation into the enterprise mainstream."

Content: "The most popular LLMs: Google is seeing a surge in developer adoption, with 69% reporting Google model usage in the first quarter of 2025, compared to OpenAI's 55%. Emerging players: DeepSeek has seen rapid growth, with 17% adoption so far in 2025 and 80% of respondents reporting they're open to using it in the workplace. Job market impact: Only about 1 in 10 developers believe LLMs will lead to layoffs, while 82% are optimistic about GenAI's impact on their work and career prospects. 72% of organizations anticipate increased LLM spending in the coming year, and nearly 40% are already investing more than $250,000 USD annually."

Content: "Among early adopters, OpenAI's reasoning models have seen the greatest traction. Despite significant industry buzz around DeepSeek, enterprises are overwhelmingly adopting OpenAI, with 23% of enterprises surveyed already using OpenAI's o3 model in production compared to just 3% for DeepSeek. DeepSeek's adoption was higher among startups relative to its low pickup in the enterprise. With several highly capable LLMs now available, it's become the norm to have multiple models deployed in production use cases. While one reason for this is certainly to avoid vendor lock-in, model differentiation by use case has become increasingly pronounced and is the main reason enterprises buy models from multiple vendors. In this year's survey, 37% of respondents are now using 5 or more models as opposed to 29% last year. Companies now approach model selection with disciplined evaluation frameworks, and factors such as security—which was heavily emphasized in our interviews—and cost have gained ground on overall accuracy and reliability. This shift underscores the increased trust enterprises have in model performance and the confidence that LLMs will be deployed at scale. As one leader succinctly summarized, 'for most tasks, all the models perform well enough now—so pricing has become a much more important'"

URL: https://menlovc.com/perspective/2025-mid-year-llm-market-update/
Content: "Foundation models are not just powering generative AI. They are shaping the future of computing. As their capabilities and economics evolve, so will the systems, applications, and industries built on top of them. Model API spending has more than doubled in this brief period—jumping from $3.5 billion (of a total $13.8 billion generative AI spend we estimated last year) to $8.4 billion. Enterprises are increasing production inference rather than just model development, marking a shift from previous years. Code generation has become AI's first breakout use case. Beyond pre-training, foundation models are now scaling along a second axis: reinforcement learning with verifiers. And while open-source continues to advance, the slowdown in frontier breakthroughs from Western labs has tempered what had previously been a rise in enterprise adoption. As a result, enterprise dollars are now consolidating around a few high-performing, closed-source models, giving us a new market leader in Anthropic."

Content: "If your organization's goal is to protect data, maintain trust, and avoid costly downtime, it's essential to stay on top of the mentioned cyber security trends that will shape 2025. With new vulnerabilities coming out, attackers are swiftly taking advantage of them with AI malware, supply chain infiltration, and social engineering. Defensive measures that can dramatically lower risk meanwhile include zero trust frameworks, AI-based anomaly detection, and continuous patching. Zero Trust Architectures: With perimeter based security becoming obsolete, zero trust becomes the new hot thing. Zero trust gives blanket access only after initial authentication and then revalidates every request. Against the backdrop of lateral movement, a hallmark of advanced breaches, this approach provides an important option for defenders. Zero trust is one of the top cyber security trends in 2025, with more and more organizations adopting micro-segmentation, user context checks. Shortage of Skilled Professionals: The high demand and specialized skill requirements of cybersecurity make the cybersecurity talent crunch a reality that even major enterprises struggle to fill critical roles. There is a limited supply of skilled analysts, threat hunters, and DevSecOps experts. This shortage prevents new deployments of top cyber security trends such as zero trust and AI driven detection. This gap can be addressed through external partnerships, managed security services."

[98]: "This evolution unfolds alongside a broader shift across Europe's startup scene, which continues to mature. As of Q1 2025, the continent counts 601 unicorns, with 16 new ones formed in 2024 and 15 so far in 2025. Although the pace has slowed since the boom of 2020–2021, the emphasis on quality over quantity signals a more sustainable and balanced market. The Central and Eastern European startup ecosystem has a distinctive place on the European innovation map. While it still trails behind Western Europe in the number of scaleups and total funding, its growth trajectory has been defined by strong technical talent, lower operating costs, availability of public funding, and the increasing involvement of both regional and international investors. Oct 30 Swedish legaltech Legora secures $150M led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Oct 30 French fintech startup FAKTUS raises €56M to transform financing for Europe's construction SMEs. Oct 30 German firm Scavenger AI secures €2.5M to simplify data analytics for SMEs. Oct 29 French biotech firm Primaa secures €7M to expand AI cancer diagnostics."

[99]: "Boston moved up one rank, entering the Top Five Global Startup Ecosystems again after two years in the #6 position. Paris moved up two positions to #12, driven by increase in the number of unicorns and early-stage deal count. Hong Kong made the most significant improvement of all Top 40 Global Startup Ecosystems, moving up from the Emerging Ecosystems ranking in 2024 to #27 globally this year. Now in its 13th year, the GSER provides insights into the world's leading startup ecosystems, emerging trends, and key challenges facing entrepreneurs. It is based on extensive research and analysis of data from 5 million startups across 350+ global ecosystems and over a decade of independent research and providing policy advice to more than 185 economic and innovation ministries and public/private agencies in over 65 countries."

[100]: "AI has changed the game: The extraordinary valuations and accelerated timelines of AI unicorns have reshaped expectations in the startup ecosystem. Sector rotation is real: Different sectors lead unicorn creation in different eras, reflecting broader technology and market trends. The bar is rising: With greater scrutiny on unit economics and business fundamentals, the requirements for reaching unicorn status have become more stringent since 2022. As we look ahead, the unicorn landscape will undoubtedly continue to evolve. While the days of unprecedented unicorn creation in 2021 may not return soon, the global innovation ecosystem remains robust. Truly transformative companies with strong business models and genuine competitive advantages will continue to achieve unicorn status, providing investors with opportunities for outsized returns and reshaping industries across the global economy. When Aileen Lee first identified the 'unicorn club' in 2013, it contained just 39 companies—true to the mythical rarity implied by the name. However, as venture capital has become more abundant and technology companies have scaled more rapidly, the unicorn has become a more common species in the startup ecosystem."

[101]: "'Viva Technology serves as a nexus for innovation and collaboration,' says Olivia Hervy, Chief Ecosystem Officer at VivaTech. 'It's where local founders gain global exposure, where VCs discover the next unicorns, and where policymakers, corporates, and startups align around the future.' Other ecosystems are applying this playbook as well. Amsterdam's The Next Web (TNW) uses AI-powered tools to match founders with relevant investors and corporate partners. One beneficiary was Roboat, which partnered with Holland Shipyards Group after attending TNW, resulting in an autonomous ferry for the 2024 Paris Olympics. On the investor side, the recently-launched VC Office Hours provide curated access to top-tier funds. One such success is Inbolt, which raised a $16.7 million Series A after winning the Female Founders Challenge, and then went on to land major contracts with Stellantis, Ford, and Beko, all from connections made at the event. Hervy puts it simply: 'Every minute at VivaTech is optimized for outcomes. That's why startups come back, and why they keep leveling up.'"

[102]: "Enterprise Value 7.7K Alumni Founders 182K Patents 246 N. of unicorns -2.2% Funding growth (19-20 v 23-24). Paris's ecosystem has really accelerated over the last 12-24 months, largely due to the AI talent and new wave of repeat founders. The AI Action Summit in the beginning of 2025 also put France's ecosystem front and center on a global level. The current geopolitical climate could also sway more talent towards France. The funding environment is good. This year, Lagos (#1) is topping the list, having created 5 unicorns and grown its ecosystem valuation 11.6x since 2017 despite a smaller economy. The Rising Stars list highlights a wide range of ecosystems from emerging markets such as Africa, India, Türkiye and Brazil. Investment in $100M+ rounds 21-24. Ecosystem Momentum Total funding growth (%) 19-20 vs 23-24. Value Creation Enterprise Value 2024 Combined total valuation of startups. Total number of unicorns and $1B+ exits. Startups that reach $1B+ valuation milestone. New unicorns and $1B+ exits Growth rate of unicorn production from '17-'20 to '21-'24. Innovation & talent University talent & linkage Founders from local universities that raised $1-15M, $15-100M, and $100M+."

[103]: "As data risks multiply and AI adoption accelerates, 2025 marks a high-stakes year for global compliance. From sweeping EU regulations to state-level US privacy laws and India's long-awaited data protection act, enterprise leaders need to stay ahead of rapidly shifting obligations. This guide breaks down the top regulations taking effect or seeing major enforcement in 2025—what they mean, who's affected, what's at stake. 2025 represents a turning point for enterprises grappling with data visibility, regulatory sprawl, and AI accountability. BigID helps organizations proactively manage sensitive data, scale privacy operations, and automate compliance across jurisdictions. Whether preparing for DORA, adapting to India's DPDPA, or managing a growing patchwork of U.S. privacy laws, BigID connects the dots between data governance and regulatory resilience—so you don't just meet requirements, you lead the way. Summary: The SEC now requires public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents within four business days and mandates annual reporting on risk oversight, including board-level accountability. Who's Affected: All publicly traded companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges."

[104]: "One of the biggest trends shaping data privacy in 2025 is the accelerating convergence of AI governance and privacy compliance, says Ryan Johnson, chief privacy officer and principal of The Technology Law Group. As organizations deploy generative AI tools, they must grapple with challenges like data minimization, model transparency and how personal data is processed within automated systems. Global data privacy laws are evolving and expanding rapidly. In the US, the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025 is under discussion to modernize government data collection and give individuals stronger legal rights. Elsewhere, the EU's 'ProtectEU' initiative seeks to enable lawful access to encrypted data for law enforcement by 2030, raising privacy and security concerns. Data privacy is governed by laws and policies that define how organizations must handle personal data and the rights individuals have over it. These include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."

[105]: "AI regulations are tightening in 2025, with the EU AI Act and the Colorado AI Act leading the way. The top AI concerns are AI hallucinations, privacy breaches, and third-party risks. AI Impact Assessments (AIRA) are becoming essential for privacy professionals. Businesses must embed AI governance into their existing privacy frameworks. Transparency, consumer rights, and vendor risk management are critical for compliance. AI systems trained on personal data present challenges for data deletion rights under GDPR. Privacy professionals must determine how individuals can request AI systems to 'forget' their data and whether AI-generated insights qualify as personal data. Article 25 GDPR obliges data controllers to adopt measures and safeguards to deal with risks to data protection principles, while Article 32 GDPR establishes an obligation to address risks to cybersecurity. In the AI Act, the providers of high-risk AI systems are required to adopt risk management."

[106]: "Legal Team Coordination: Organisations should ensure their legal, compliance, and technology teams work closely together on AI governance. This coordination becomes increasingly essential as regulations become more technically complex and enforcement intensifies. Connecticut: Bills addressing AI in healthcare and government services. Massachusetts: Legislation focusing on AI in criminal justice and policing. Texas: Proposed measures addressing AI in education and employment. The trend toward state-level regulation shows no signs of slowing, with many states viewing AI governance as essential for protecting residents while federal legislation remains uncertain. Different sectors face unique regulatory requirements based on existing industry regulations and AI application contexts: Healthcare: AI systems in healthcare must comply with HIPAA privacy requirements, FDA medical device regulations, and state medical practice laws. Healthcare AI developers must consider patient safety, data privacy, and clinical validation requirements to ensure the effective implementation of AI in healthcare."

[147]: BuzzClan - "Vendor Lock-in Prevention Multi-Cloud Strategy Guide 2025"
"Modern businesses operate across multiple jurisdictions with varying regulatory requirements. Vendor lock-in can create compliance risks when organizations cannot quickly adapt their technology stack to meet new regulatory demands. For healthcare organizations, this might mean an inability to comply with new patient data protection requirements if their current vendor doesn't support necessary security features. [...] BuzzClan's methodology addresses the full spectrum of vendor lock-in risks through strategic planning, technical implementation, and ongoing optimization. We help organizations develop robust cloud migration strategies that prioritize portability, implement effective cloud governance frameworks, and establish monitoring systems that work across multiple cloud environments. Strategic Cloud Architecture Design [...] Enterprise cloud costs are spiraling, and vendor lock-in is often the hidden culprit. Despite 89% of organizations adopting multi-cloud strategies, many remain trapped in inflexible arrangements that drive up costs and limit agility. Recent data shows that 42% of companies are considering moving workloads back on-premises to escape vendor dependencies."

[148]: Ariel Softwares - "Multi Cloud Strategy in 2025: When It's Smart and When It's ..."
"Vendor lock-in can be a real business risk, both technically and commercially. If AWS raises prices or GCP discontinues a critical service, you're stuck if your stack is too tightly coupled to their platform. With a multi-cloud strategy, you maintain bargaining power, protect against vendor outages, and reduce exposure to sudden pricing changes. It's an insurance policy for mission-critical workloads and a smart move when combined with solid multi-cloud management. [...] In such a setup, multi-cloud management becomes essential to handle operations, security, and costs across environments. Whether it's Azure cloud optimization or abstracting services through containers, orchestration must be thoughtful. You're Strategically Hedging Vendor Lock-In Risk [...] The Multi-Cloud Dilemma: Flexibility or Fragmentation? In 2025, a multi cloud strategy is more than just tech jargon; it's a headline topic in boardrooms, webinars, and vendor decks. Tech panels praise it. Cloud providers promote it. CTOs often cite it as a shield against vendor dependency and risk. But behind the buzz lies a sharper question: Is a multi-cloud strategy truly the smarter choice, or is it an operational and financial trap in disguise?"

[149]: IT Convergence - "Multi-Cloud Strategies for 2025: Architect Smarter, Run ..."
"As of 2025, 70% of enterprises use multiple public clouds, averaging 2.4 per org and most cite vendor lock-in avoidance and resiliency as their top motivators. Overcoming Multi-Cloud Challenges. While multi-cloud unlocks agility, compliance, and innovation, it introduces real complexity, especially at enterprise scale. Here's how today's top organizations are tackling the top blockers: Fragmented Security Posture [...] Among professional services, 65% of firms cite the ability to avoid vendor lock-in as a key driver for multi-cloud. For these knowledge-based firms, flexibility and client data compliance across jurisdictions are paramount. [...] What are the biggest benefits of a multi-cloud strategy in 2025? Multi-cloud enables organizations to optimize performance, cost, and compliance by selecting the best-fit cloud for each workload. It also reduces vendor lock-in and strengthens business continuity."

[150]: Growin - "The Rise of Multi-Cloud Strategies: Discover the Pros ... - Business 2025"
"In 2025, the adoption of multi-cloud strategies has accelerated significantly, driven by a confluence of technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and evolving business needs. Here's an in-depth look at the key factors propelling this trend: 1. Avoidance of Vendor Lock-In"

[151]: DRJ - "Understanding the Risks of Cloud Vendor Lock-In"
"Data migration issues – Transferring data to another platform can be complex and costly. Limited scalability – adding services and applications may be limited. Limited control over the technology stack – Relying on one service provider limits the ability to make technical adjustments to meet specific needs."

## Conclusion
벤더 록인은 2025년 기업이 직면한 가장 중요한 기술 리스크 중 하나로, 89%의 조직이 멀티클라우드 전략을 채택했음에도 불구하고 42%가 온프레미스 복귀를 고려할 정도로 심각합니다. 70%의 기업이 평균 2.4개의 퍼블릭 클라우드를 사용하며 벤더 록인 회피를 최우선 동기로 꼽고 있습니다. 주요 리스크로는 데이터 마이그레이션의 복잡성과 비용, 제한된 확장성, 기술 스택 통제력 상실, 가격 인상 및 서비스 중단 위험이 있으며, 특히 의료와 같은 규제 산업에서는 컴플라이언스 리스크로 이어질 수 있습니다.

[157]: TrustCloud - "Powerful guide to data privacy compliance challenges in 2025"
"Navigating the regulatory landscape for data privacy compliance can be complex and challenging. Organizations must adhere to various regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and others, which often have differing requirements. Here are some best practices for overcoming these data privacy compliance challenges: [...] One of the fundamental challenges organizations encounter is complying with diverse regulations across different regions. For example, a company operating globally must reconcile the stringent data protection requirements of GDPR with the nuanced provisions of CCPA. The balancing act of adhering to multiple sets of rules is no small feat, requiring meticulous planning and implementation of robust compliance frameworks. [...] For organizations, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for data processing, including obtaining explicit consent, ensuring data accuracy, implementing data protection measures, and reporting data breaches in a timely manner. The regulation also mandates the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) for certain organizations, highlighting the importance of having dedicated personnel to oversee data privacy compliance."

[158]: Usercentrics - "Data Privacy Trends Shaping 2025 and the Years Ahead"
"In the EU, AI adoption is creating some of the most evident compliance challenges in 2025. The AI Act brought groundbreaking restrictions and rules for integrating AI and handling data privacy, while at the same time working to encourage continued innovation. The first phase of enforcement started on February 2, 2025, introducing prohibited AI practices and AI literacy requirements. The entirety of the Act becomes enforceable in 2026. [...] GDPR and marketing guide to help your business adopt Privacy-Led Marketing to comply with GDPR requirements in 2025 and beyond.

Brazil's LGPD, which was strongly influenced by the GDPR, but has since evolved to meet the country's specific challenges and innovation requirements [...] Cross-border data transfer challenges: With tariff wars, questions about administration changes, and reestablishing trade agreements in 2025, complex global digital ecosystems face new challenges in maintaining privacy standards."

[159]: Gable.ai - "Data Compliance: What You Need to Know in 2025"
"The healthcare industry's unique requirements for data privacy and protection underscore the importance of compliance programs that address sector-specific regulations. However, by embedding robust data safeguards and adopting healthcare-compliant data storage and access controls, data leaders in relevant industries ensure that patient data remains protected while their organization maintains optimal compliance. Analysis: Increasingly critical data compliance challenges in 2025 [...] Data silos will continue to be significant barriers to compliance in 2025. Fragmented data spread across systems or departments prevents organizations from implementing consistent security controls, such as access control and authentication, which are critical for ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. These silos also hinder effective governance and make it difficult to meet requirements for data accuracy, accessibility, and storage management. [...] Doing so creates specific challenges for anyone in these roles, including the mounting complexities of new regulations (both broad and niche), the persistent need to keep data de-siloed, and consumers who, on average, care more about the information they share online, and who expect far more transparency from those who use it. Keeping pace with stricter regulations and global standardization."

[160]: ITSASAP - "Common Problems with GDPR Compliance (& How to Solve Them)"
"Businesses handling personal data face growing pressure to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Yet, navigating GDPR compliance can feel like a maze of legal jargon and technical requirements. This article will dive into the most common GDPR challenges businesses encounter and, more importantly, how to solve them effectively."

[161]: Didomi - "Everything you need to know about GDPR compliance in 2025"
"Being prepared for what comes next in privacy law involves using a flexible, robust compliance system capable of automatically adapting to new requirements, wherever and whenever they apply. To discuss your data privacy and compliance challenges and see whether we can help, book a call with our team of experts. [...] The GDPR requires in Article 25 for data protection to be integrated into the designs of systems, services, and products from the outset, rather than as an add-on or afterthought, a core privacy concept known as "privacy by design and default." [...] These variations, which stem from factors that include varied enforcement philosophies, resourcing levels, and national legal cultures, can create legal gray zones and multi-jurisdictional compliance challenges for organizations, despite the supposed "uniformity" of the GDPR among EU nations."

## Conclusion
2025년 데이터 프라이버시 및 규제 준수는 다국적 컴플라이언스의 복잡성, AI Act와 같은 새로운 규제의 도입, 국경 간 데이터 전송 도전과제로 인해 더욱 어려워지고 있습니다. 데이터 사일로가 일관된 보안 통제 구현을 방해하는 중요한 장벽으로 남아 있으며, GDPR의 "privacy by design and default" 원칙은 시스템 설계 초기부터 데이터 보호를 통합할 것을 요구합니다. EU 국가 간 집행 철학과 자원 수준의 차이는 법적 회색 지대를 만들며, 소비자들은 온라인에서 공유하는 정보에 대해 더 많은 투명성을 기대하고 있습니다. 조직들은 새로운 요구사항에 자동으로 적응할 수 있는 유연하고 강력한 컴플라이언스 시스템이 필요합니다.

- 2025년을 내다보면 IT 직업 환경이 중요한 변화를 맞이할 준비가 되어 있음
- AI 전문가, 데이터 과학자, 사이버보안 분석가와 같은 역할이 높은 수요를 보임

**기술 인재 부족의 현황** [163]
- 기술 인재 부족이 여러 분야와 산업, 특히 AI, 머신러닝, 데이터 과학에 숙련된 전문가를 고용하고 유지해야 하는 조직 내에서 계속 도전과제로 작용
- Robert Half의 연구에 따르면, 58%의 기술 관리자가 2025년 상반기에 새로운 직책을 위한 채용을 계획하고 있으며, 39%는 공석 직책만을 위한 채용 계획
- 그러나 87%의 기술 관리자가 오늘날 숙련된 전문가를 찾는 것이 어렵다고 말함
- 사이버보안과 소프트웨어가 가장 큰 스킬 갭을 가진 두 가지 기술 영역으로, 각각 45%와 37%
- IT Industry Outlook 2025에 따르면 거의 모든 종류와 수준의 기술 직업도 부족에 직면
- "공급과 수요 간의 불균형은 사이버보안 및 데이터와 같은 영역에서 정의가 필요할 수 있더라도 초급 역할에 대한 더 많은 고려를 강제할 것"

**사이버보안 인력의 AI 스킬 부족** [164]
- ISC2 사이버보안 인력 연구에 따르면 AI 숙련 근로자의 부족이 심각
- 보안 관련 AI 스킬을 가진 근로자의 필요성뿐만 아니라, 16,000명의 응답자가 AI가 사이버보안과 직무 역할 전반에 미칠 영향에 대해 깊이 있게 다룸
- 예산 삭감이 인력을 감소시킬 것이며, 이미 언급된 바와 같음

[162]: InformationWeek - "The Growing IT Skills Gap: A Looming Crisis for 2025"
"Examining the current IT workforce reveals critical gaps. For instance, skills in AI, machine learning, blockchain, and cybersecurity are notably scarce. Both large tech firms and startups face challenges in finding qualified candidates, leading to project delays and reduced innovation. [...] The latest forecasts depict a stark picture: the tech sector is on the verge of a severe shortage of skilled professionals. This looming IT skill gap threatens both individual companies and the global economy. Without action, firms may not be able to stay competitive, and innovation could stall. The IT skill gap represents the disparity between the skills employers need and what the workforce can offer. This gap spans various technology areas, including cybersecurity, data analytics, and cloud [...] Looking ahead to 2025, the IT job landscape is poised for significant changes. Technological progress and shifting market needs will shape this evolution. Roles will emerge, and others will decline. Hybrid positions, blending technical skills with non-tech abilities, will also be on the rise. Roles such as AI specialists, data scientists, and cybersecurity analysts are in high demand. Companies are investing in these areas to remain competitive and secure."

[163]: GTIA - "The Tech Skills Gap Is Growing: What's Your Talent Strategy?"
"The technology talent shortage continues to challenge multiple fields and industries, particularly within organizations that need to hire and retain professionals skilled in AI, machine learning and data science. According to research from Robert Half, 58% of technology managers plan to recruit for new positions in the first half of 2025, while 39% plan to hire for vacated positions only. However, 87% of technology managers say it's challenging to find skilled professionals today. This talent [...] While cybersecurity and software represent the two tech areas with the greatest skills gap, 45% and 37% respectively, almost every kind of and level of tech job also faces a shortage, according to the IT Industry Outlook 2025. "The imbalance between supply and demand will force more consideration of entry level roles, even if these roles may require definition in areas like cybersecurity and data," according to the report."

[164]: IBM Think - "ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study: Shortage of AI skilled workers"
"The cyber workforce in the world of AI: Looking at the overall picture of how AI skills will fit into the cybersecurity workforce going forward, it is likely that the issues that hamper hiring today will have a similar impact on AI expertise. Budget cuts will decrease the workforce, as already mentioned. France pointed to the human resources gap as well, where entry-level positions are posted with requirements such as certifications that require five years of work experience. [...] It's not just the need for workers with security-related AI skills. The Workforce Study also takes a deep dive into how the 16,000 respondents think AI will impact cybersecurity and job roles overall, from changing skills approaches to creating generative AI (gen AI) strategies. Budgets and the skills gap [...] Many of the respondents pointed out that the skills gap has had a more negative effect on organizational security than the decrease in on-site staff. In part because the funding isn't available for training and because those with skills in high demand are moving on to better-paying positions, many security teams struggle to address the threats and risks in today's cybersecurity landscape."

[165]: CompTIA - "State of Cybersecurity 2025"
"That mindset is not sustainable now, especially with the wide range of skill gaps that need to be filled. Mid-career employees may have depth of specialization, but there are not currently enough to meet demand. Companies must give more consideration to building a pipeline of cybersecurity talent through a combination of hiring early career specialists and providing internal training to allow for career growth or reskilling opportunities. [...] This is evident in the next challenge on the list. Following closely behind AI-specific skills, companies need improvement in foundational cybersecurity skills. These skills not only ensure that cybersecurity approaches are following best practices, they also provide the necessary input for training AI systems properly. One downside of AI tools is that they can act as a black box, obscuring decision-making algorithms and complicating optimization. Without the prerequisite skills in [...] CompTIA's AI Framework provides a model for the type of skill-building needed in the AI era. The different elements of the AI Framework cross over the different job families making up the tech workforce. Cybersecurity professionals will certainly require both depth and breadth in AI Security skills, but they will also require some level of skill in the other domains of AI Interaction, AI Systems, AI Data Analytics, AI Architecture, and AI DevOps."

[166]: McKinsey - "AI in the workplace: A report for 2025"
"Business leaders need to embrace this speed and optimism to ensure that their companies don't get left behind. Yet despite all the excitement and early experimentation, 47 percent of C-suite leaders say their organizations are developing and releasing gen AI tools too slowly, citing talent skill gaps as a key reason for the delay."

## Conclusion
2025년 기술 인력 부족과 스킬 갭은 심각한 위기 수준에 도달했습니다. 87%의 기술 관리자가 숙련된 전문가를 찾는 것이 어렵다고 보고하며, 사이버보안(45%)과 소프트웨어(37%)가 가장 큰 스킬 갭을 보이고 있습니다. AI, 머신러닝, 블록체인 분야의 스킬이 특히 부족하며, 이는 프로젝트 지연과 혁신 감소로 이어지고 있습니다. ISC2 연구에 따르면 스킬 갭이 현장 직원 감소보다 조직 보안에 더 부정적인 영향을 미치고 있으며, McKinsey는 47%의 C-suite 리더가 인재 스킬 갭을 생성형 AI 도구 개발 지연의 주요 원인으로 꼽았다고 보고합니다. 기업들은 초급 인재 채용과 내부 교육을 결합한 인재 파이프라인 구축이 필요합니다.

- 45%의 조직이 1,000개 이상의 애플리케이션을 관리하고 있음
- 이러한 애플리케이션 확산은 각 새로운 시스템이 잠재적으로 기존 인프라에 대한 연결을 필요로 하기 때문에 기하급수적인 통합 도전과제를 만듦
- 평균 기업이 897개의 서로 다른 애플리케이션을 실행하며, 각 애플리케이션이 적절히 통합되지 않으면 또 다른 사일로를 만들 가능성이 있음

**아키텍처 복잡성과 기술 부채** [168]
- 수년에 걸쳐 레거시 애플리케이션은 깊이 결합된 구성 요소, 구식 설계 패턴, 문서화되지 않은 로직을 축적
- 이러한 시스템은 적응성이 아닌 안정성을 위해 구축됨
- 상호운용성 없이는 현대화가 단편화됨: 통합이 실패하고, 데이터 사일로가 지속되며, 시스템이 구식 패러다임에 갇혀 있음
- 이는 클라우드 앱 현대화, AI 또는 자동화 플랫폼을 효과적으로 채택하는 능력을 심각하게 제한
- 복잡한 레거시 아키텍처, 까다로운 시스템 통합, 데이터 마이그레이션 리스크, 보안 취약점, 팀의 저항, 사내 적절한 인재 부족 등이 주요 도전과제
- 단순한 기술 업그레이드가 아니라 비즈니스 및 문화 변화임

**레거시 시스템의 비용과 리스크** [169]
- 레거시 시스템이 중요 부문 전반의 조직을 계속 괴롭히며, 단순한 유지보수 비용을 훨씬 넘어서는 도전과제의 연쇄를 만듦

[167]: Adalo - "50 Integration Challenges with Legacy Technologies in B2B Stats"
"Organizations deploy an average of 897 applications across their enterprise. MuleSoft's 2025 research reveals the staggering complexity of modern IT environments, with 45% of organizations managing over 1,000 applications. This application sprawl creates exponential integration challenges as each new system potentially requires connections to existing infrastructure. Organizations using modern no-code platforms eliminate these bottlenecks through visual development tools that simplify [...] Average enterprise runs 897 different applications. MuleSoft's 2025 research reveals the staggering complexity of modern IT environments. Each application potentially creates another silo if not properly integrated. Visual integration tools manage this complexity through centralized connectivity management. [...] 95% of organizations struggle to integrate data across their systems. MuleSoft's 2025 Connectivity Benchmark Report reveals that nearly all enterprises face challenges connecting disparate data sources and applications. This statistic underscores how outdated integration approaches have become the primary bottleneck preventing organizations from leveraging transformative technologies like AI. The gap between data integration needs and current capabilities creates competitive disadvantages."

[168]: Softura - "Top 10 Legacy Application Modernization Challenges in 2025"
"Over years, legacy application accumulates deeply coupled components, outdated design patterns, and undocumented logic. These systems were built for stability, not adaptability. [...] The challenge is that without interoperability, modernization becomes fragmented. Integrations fail, data silos persist, and systems remain stuck in outdated paradigms. This severely limits the ability to adopt cloud app modernization, AI, or automation platforms effectively. [...] There are quite a few, but the big ones include dealing with complex legacy architecture, tricky system integrations, data migration risks, security vulnerabilities, resistance from teams, and not having the right talent in-house. It is not just a tech upgrade, it is a business and culture shift, too."

[169]: Pragmatic Coders - "2025 Legacy Code Stats: Costs, Risks & Modernization"
"Legacy systems continue to plague organizations across critical sectors, creating a cascade of challenges that extend far beyond simple maintenance costs. From financial institutions processing billions in daily transactions on decades-old COBOL systems to hospitals managing patient care with outdated software, the pervasive nature of this challenge demands immediate attention. [...] Modernization Challenges: High upfront investment costs (~$2.9M average), Complexity and risk of large-scale transformation, Potential for system downtime and data loss, Organizational resistance to change, Lack of internal expertise. Sources: GAO Report, Storyblok Developer Survey. The Modernization Imperative: The imperative for legacy system modernization is driven by a confluence of critical factors that impact an organization's financial health, operational agility, security posture, and competitive standing. Escalating Maintenance Costs: Consuming 70-80% of IT budgets. Security Vulnerabilities: Leading to increased cyberattacks. Operational Inefficiencies: Hindering productivity and innovation."

[170]: Future Processing - "Legacy system modernisation: challenges and common approaches"
"Legacy systems can hold businesses back – but modernising them isn't always straightforward. From technical hurdles to strategic decisions, the journey comes with challenges. Let's explore what makes modernisation complex and the best approaches to get it right."

[171]: Integrass - "Integrating AI into Legacy Apps: Key Challenges & Solutions [2025]"
"Key Challenges of Integrating AI into Legacy Applications: 1. Compatibility Issues - Legacy apps weren't built to handle AI models, modern algorithms, or even cloud-based processing. These applications often run on outdated architectures, making AI integration a technical headache. Older systems may struggle to process large datasets, connect with modern APIs, or even support the computational load AI demands. Solution: Introduce middleware that acts as a bridge between legacy apps and AI models. Use API wrappers to help old systems communicate with new AI-driven modules. Gradually modernize components instead of overhauling everything at once. 2. Data Quality & Accessibility - AI thrives on data, but legacy systems often store information in siloed databases or outdated formats. Poorly structured data, missing records, and duplicate entries can throw AI models off balance. Solution: Shift AI-related workloads to cloud-based servers or edge computing solutions. Optimize legacy code to reduce redundancy and improve execution speeds. Use containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to isolate AI workloads without overloading the main system. 4. Security & Compliance Risks."

## Conclusion
레거시 시스템 통합의 복잡성은 2025년 조직들이 직면한 가장 심각한 도전과제 중 하나입니다. 95%의 조직이 시스템 전반의 데이터 통합에 어려움을 겪고 있으며, 평균 기업이 897개의 애플리케이션을 운영하고 있습니다(45%는 1,000개 이상). 레거시 시스템 현대화의 평균 비용은 290만 달러이며, IT 예산의 70-80%가 유지보수에 소비되고 있습니다. 주요 도전과제로는 깊이 결합된 구성 요소와 문서화되지 않은 로직으로 인한 아키텍처 복잡성, AI 모델과의 호환성 문제, 사일로화된 데이터베이스, 보안 취약점, 조직적 저항, 내부 전문성 부족이 있습니다. 솔루션으로는 미들웨어 도입, API 래퍼 사용, 점진적 현대화, 컨테이너화가 제시되고 있습니다.

Businesses integrating these ethical practices are better positioned to avoid biases, ensure transparency, and comply with critical regulations like GDPR and the EU AI Act. With proper governance, continuous monitoring, and a focus on fairness and privacy, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI while safeguarding their reputation and customer trust. [...] It ensures that AI technologies are designed to avoid harm, mitigate biases, and promote inclusivity while being transparent about decisions. Responsible AI is about making AI systems more understandable, explainable, and trustworthy. It addresses potential ethical concerns by ensuring that AI models operate without discrimination, protect user privacy, and offer clear insights into decision-making."

[173]: Phenom - "Ethical AI Principles: Fairness, Transparency, and Trust in HR"
"As AI continues to redefine how organizations hire, develop, and retain talent, questions of trust, accountability, and transparency have taken center stage. Except now, it's not enough for AI to simply perform; it has to do so ethically, securely, and in alignment with human values. [...] Responsible AI refers to the overarching approach of designing, developing, and implementing artificial intelligence systems with deliberate attention to ethical principles, such as fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability. It encompasses the full lifecycle of AI, from data collection and model training to deployment and ongoing monitoring, ensuring that the systems align with organizational values, comply with regulations, and safeguard user rights. [...] The pillars of ethical AI are fairness, accountability, privacy, and transparency. Fairness ensures that candidates are treated without bias, accountability holds developers responsible for their AI's actions, privacy safeguards personal data, and transparency allows stakeholders to trust in the operations of the AI system. Together, these pillars guide the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies."

"Ethics in AI is essential as it significantly impacts our society. Ethical considerations ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency. AI can have profound societal implications, from job displacements due to automation to biases in decision-making systems. Without ethical considerations, AI can unintentionally reinforce societal inequalities and prejudices. [...] Therefore, accountability in the context of AI refers to the responsibility to justify and explain AI systems' decisions. It is focused on ensuring transparency, fairness, and ethical use of AI in health wearables. The following parties are accountable for ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI in health wearables: 1. Developers: AI model developers must ensure their models are designed fairly and ethically."

[175]: Taylor & Francis - "AI Ethics: Integrating Transparency, Fairness, and Privacy in AI ..."
"Embedding ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and accountability into AI systems requires sophisticated algorithmic approaches that ensure these objectives are met without compromising the system's performance. Algorithmic fairness can be addressed using methods such as differential fairness and fair representation learning. For instance, algorithms like the Fair Representation Learning (FRL) model aim to mitigate bias by transforming raw data into a latent representation that is [...] Establishing clear lines of responsibility and accountability in AI-driven decisions is also crucial. Continuous improvement, based on feedback from users and stakeholders, should be an integral part of AI development. The ultimate goal is to create AI systems that embody ethical principles, ensuring all users' safety and well-being. Responsible AI Frameworks [...] Clear lines of responsibility and accountability should be established in AI-driven decisions. Continuous improvement based on feedback from users and stakeholders should be a regular practice. The goal is the realization of AI systems that fully embody ethical principles and ensure the safety and well-being of all users."

[176]: AIMultiple - "Responsible AI: 4 Principles & Best Practices"
"AI and machine learning are revolutionizing industries, with 90% of commercial apps expected to use AI by 2025 as AI statistics shows. Despite this, 65% of risk leaders feel unprepared to manage AI-related risks effectively. 'In a world of risk, pace comes from preparation.' - Accenture. [...] To ensure these tools align with ethical values, organizations should adopt tools that comply with their AI policy, covering safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability."

## Conclusion
윤리적 AI와 기술 책임은 2025년 가장 중요한 이슈로 부상했습니다. 2025년까지 상업용 앱의 90%가 AI를 사용할 것으로 예상되지만, 65%의 리스크 리더가 AI 관련 리스크를 효과적으로 관리할 준비가 되어 있지 않다고 느낍니다. 책임 있는 AI의 핵심 원칙은 공정성(편향 없는 다양한 데이터셋 훈련), 투명성(이해 가능하고 설명 가능한 모델), 책임성(명확한 감독 메커니즘), 프라이버시(개인 데이터 보호)입니다. 윤리적 고려 없이 AI는 의도치 않게 사회적 불평등과 편견을 강화할 수 있으며, 자동화로 인한 일자리 대체부터 의사결정 시스템의 편향까지 심오한 사회적 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 조직들은 GDPR 및 EU AI Act와 같은 규제를 준수하면서 안전성, 공정성, 투명성, 책임성을 다루는 AI 정책을 채택해야 합니다.
