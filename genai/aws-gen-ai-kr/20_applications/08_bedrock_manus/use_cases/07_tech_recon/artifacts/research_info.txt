## Original full text
[36]: "In 2025, pharma executives who have proactively implemented and documented AI processes that allow teams to adopt new technology quickly will stand apart and be competitive from those who have failed to implement a coordinated AI strategy. This will require a focus on workforce education, internal alignment on AI use cases, as well as anticipated results and the deployment of the technology in a cross-functional manner that includes executive leaders."
[37]: "For AI to live up to its potential, pharma executives need to not simply invest in the technology, but also must consider the processes needed to ensure adoption and ongoing performance. This will require educating your workforce and critical stakeholders that are involved in the process, from acquisition and procurement through implementation and ongoing use of AI tools."
[38]: "Nationwide, the shift to advanced manufacturing and digitization is exposing skills gaps: as of 2025, 83% of biopharma supply chain leaders say they need to upskill or reskill their workforce to support digital transformation (e.g. data analytics, automation in production). Yet currently, many workers lack these cross-disciplinary skills."
[39]: "Pfizer's CEO and leadership have made AI a core part of the company's 2025 priorities, focusing on expanding margins, simplifying operations, and driving efficiencies through technology. This isn't AI as a side project or experimental initiative, this is AI as fundamental business strategy."

## Research Findings

### Topic 27: System Integration and Security Requirements
- Key integration challenges [40]:
  * Strict regulatory compliance (GxP, HIPAA)
  * Data governance frameworks
  * Quality assurance procedures
  * Data provenance and lineage tracking
  * Ongoing monitoring requirements
- Security implementation needs [41]:
  * Vulnerability scanning every 6 months
  * Annual penetration testing
  * 72-hour disaster recovery plans
  * Audit trail monitoring
  * Access control systems

### Topic 28: Regulatory Compliance and Validation
- EU AI Act requirements [42]:
  * Initial provisions effective February 2025
  * GPAI obligations start August 2025
  * High-risk system provisions phased in
  * Risk assessment requirements
  * Human oversight measures
- Implementation timeline [43]:
  * Pre-market assessments
  * System and process updates
  * Documentation enhancement
  * Validation procedures
  * Performance monitoring

## Original full text
[40]: "HHS proposed regulations in January 2025 specify that covered entities must conduct vulnerability scanning at least every six months and penetration testing at least annually. Similarly, disaster recovery plans must outline procedures for critical system restoration within 72 hours of a loss event."
[41]: "For AI systems specifically, audit components should track user authentication, timestamp information, IP addresses, and specific application activities. Organizations must designate IT team members to actively monitor these logs, together with restricting audit trail access to those directly responsible for security monitoring."
[42]: "The AI Act came into effect on August 1, 2024, with its requirements being phased in gradually. The first provisions, including the ban on 'unacceptable risk' and the 'AI literacy' requirement, are effective from February 2, 2025. Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models (GPAI) come into effect on August 2, 2025."
[43]: "Integrate AI requirements into existing quality management systems, update software development lifecycle procedures, enhance change control processes for AI devices, implement cybersecurity requirements for AI applications, establish performance monitoring and trending capabilities."

## Original full text
[44]: "Regulators are keenly aware of this, frequently referencing data and metadata in AI guidelines, emphasizing their critical role in transforming raw information into actionable knowledge. More than 25% of warning letters issued by FDA since 2019 have cited data accuracy issues, a complex problem that continues to challenge the industry."
[45]: "Healthcare organizations must ensure they have the proper rights, licenses, and patient consents before using or sharing data with AI platforms. They should also carefully review vendor agreements, privacy policies, and terms of use to understand how data may be processed or commercialized."
[46]: "Organizations considering offshore vendors must carefully navigate a web of federal, state, and contractual requirements. While offshore arrangements are not strictly prohibited, they are subject to heightened scrutiny and specific compliance obligations."
[47]: "Healthcare privacy has evolved beyond simply checking compliance boxes. It's now about actively managing risk, adapting to regulatory changes, and meeting rising expectations from patients and partners. Organizations need to tighten security protocols, reexamine their technology infrastructure, and treat data as both a critical asset and a potential liability."
