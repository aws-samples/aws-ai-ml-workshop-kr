Decreased Revenues for Trucks, Increased for Freight Rail Companies\\n\\nSince freight volumes will be reduced during the upcoming port strike, this will lead to less work for trucks that transport goods from the ports.

Broader Implications for Other Industries and the Economy\\n\\nThe port strikes are not just a concern for the logistics and transportation industry; it’s a significant issue for all sectors globally. Many industries rely on the supply chain to get supplies, equipment, and other essentials for their inventories. [...] There is likely to be a significant backlog of imported goods awaiting customs clearance if the strike in 2025 occurs.

[...] *   이러한 상황에서, 파업이 지속될 경우 하루 최대 50억 달러의 경제적 손실이 예상되며, 이는 인플레이션과 운송비 상승으로 이어질 수 있습니다. JP모건과 옥스퍼드 이코노믹스의 분석에 따르면, 이 파업은 단기적으로 물류 혼잡과 기업의 추가 비용 발생을 초래하고 있으며, 특히 식품 및 소비재의 공급망에도 부정적인 영향을 미칠 것이라고 경고합니다. 이러한 요소들은 결국 소비자에게 직접적인 물가 부담으로 이어질 가능성이 높습니다.\\n\\n*   또한, 한국 기업들은 이번 파업의 여파를 최소화하기 위해 신속한 조기 선적과 대체 물류 경로 모색에 나서고 있으며, 정부와의 긴밀한 협력이 필요한 상황입니다. 향후 동부항만의 상황이 안정화되기 전까지 모든 이해 관계자들은 격렬한 협상과 함께 최선의 대안을 모색해야 할 것입니다.\\n\\n2. 파업의 배경 및 원인\\n--------------\\n\\n*   ### 2-1. 미국 동부항만에서의 노사 분쟁 [...] *   현재 파업의 장기화가 우려되는 가운데, 국내 수출기업들은 조기 선적을 통해 위험을 최소화하는 전략을 세우고 있습니다. 한국무역협회는 이미 파업 가능성이 제기된 이후부터 출하 계획을 조정하여 선적 일정에 대한 유연성을 최우선으로 고려하고 있습니다. 특히, 항만의 물류 적체가 해소되지 않을 경우 대체 항로를 모색하거나, 자사 물류 역량을 보강하기 위한 노력도 필요합니다. 예를 들어, 미국 서부항으로 물류를 우회하거나 대양을 횡단하는 해운 루트를 고려하는 등 다양한 대안이 필요하며, 이는 물류비용 증가와 시간 지연을 감수하는 것을 포함할 수 있습니다. 또한, 각 기업은 정부와 긴밀히 협력하며 필요한 지원을 요청하여 향후 예상되는 물류적 문제를 사전에 준비하는 것이 중요합니다.\\n\\n*   ### 5-3. 정책 입안자 및 기업의 협력 방안\"}, {\"title\": \"북미 노동자들의 항만·철도 파업, 글로벌 물류에 미칠 파장은?\", \"url\": \"https://www.seavantage.com/blog/strike\", \"content\": \"미 동부 항만 파업이 현실화되면, 그 영향은 미국을 넘어 글로벌 경제 전반에 미칠 것으로 예상됩니다.
