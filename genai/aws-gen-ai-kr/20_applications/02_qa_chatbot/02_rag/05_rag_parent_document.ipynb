Allow Work Profile (PO) creation in KME via MDM selection This feature addresses admin requests to create a KME supported PO profile (work profile) with supported MDMs. With this release, you can now choose what type of out-of-box Android Enterprise enrollment to use. Previously, KME only supported fully managed devices via Device Owner (DO) mode, but with this release KME is also supporting out-of-box work profile creation via the Profile Owner (PO) mode, as long as it is supported by the MDM. This is accomplished by adding a profile option to \"Let MDM choose\" what kind of enrollment to use. This is a new feature introduced in Android 10, and not all MDMs currently support it. When configuring Android Enterprise profile settings, an admin is now presented the option of setting MDM INFORMATION to Force Device Owner enrollment. When Force Device Owner enrollment checkbox is selected, an admin is displayed the Android Enterprise profile settings screen with settings for a DO profile. However, if the Force DO enrollment checkbox is _not_ selected the admin is displayed the Android Enterprise profile settings screen (if running Android 10 or later) to let the MDM optionally enroll as a PO (Profile Owner). Profiles created before the KCS 1.34 release are set to Force Device Owner enrollment. The default setting for any newly created profile will also have this value. For information on configuring an Android Enterprise KME profile, see Android Enterprise profiles. On-premises Intranet hosted MDM APK support Often the most time consuming parts of device enrollment is downloading the MDM APK over the public Internet. With this release you can now host and download the APK from inside your own Intranet. Besides speeding up device enrollment, you can also host private MDM APKs that are not publically available. With this release, a This MDM APK is locally hosted on an Intranet server checkbox has been added to the Android Enterprise profile details screen to provide an alternative to an externally hosted MDM agent APK. Select this option to use an APK resource from within a local company Intranet. This option is disabled by default. If the Publically available MDM APK option is selected, then a text box displays. Enter the URL of a publically accessible version of the exact same MDM APK you are hosting within your local company Intranet. By default, Samsung recommends a location based on the MDM name you may have previously selected, but this can be overwritten. If there is no publically available exact match, then select Privately available MDM APK and provide the required information associated with the Intranet hosted MDM APK. This is used for validation during device enrollment, and also to display on the Managed Provisioning screen. The Admin component name is expressed as _package name/class name_. For example, com.airwatch.androidagent/com.airwatch.agent.DeviceAdministratorReceiver for the Workspace ONE UEM. The Admin package signature checksum is the Base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the MDM APK signature, which is URL friendly. You can get this value from your MDM. Go here for information on the EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM. Alternatively, you can use utilities such as _Keytool_ on Linux to get this value. Go here\" for additional information. The MDM app name is the name of the app displayed on the Managed Provisioning screen. The App icon is the icon displayed next to the MDM app name. The minimum size is 48 x 48 pixels, and the file format needs to be a PNG file. To use this information to create an enrollment profile, see Android Enterprise profiles.

Explains how to create a Knox E-FOTA test campaign A test campaign allows you to test the campaign policies using a dummy firmware version. When you're done with your test campaign, you can revert your devices back to your regular firmware by unassigning them from the test campaign. You can't apply a real campaign on a device that has dummy firmware. Devices synced to Knox E-FOTA from an EMM can't be assigned to a test campaign. 1. Sign in to the Knox Admin Portal. In the left sidebar, click Knox E-FOTA. 2. In the Campaigns tab, click Actions > Create Test Campaign. 3. Fill in the campaign details. #Basic Info Set a unique name for the campaign and a description of what's new in it. #Schedule , Campaign period - Set the timeframe when devices in the campaign can start to download and install the update. If you want the campaign period to run indefinitely, select Set a start date only. Firmware installation period - Set the timeframe within the campaign period when the devices in the campaign can start installing the update. This timeframe is based on the device's timezone. If you want to test a campaign immediately, set the firmware installation period to the following values: From: 00:00 , To: 24:00 Devices will start installation during this period, but there is no guarantee that installation will end within this period. Firmware download period - Set the timeframe within the campaign period when the devices in the campaign can start downloading the update. You can set devices to download anytime or you can use the same timeframe as the firmware installation period. Postpone installation - Select this option if you want to allow the device user to postpone the installation. Then, set the maximum number of times they're allowed to postpone it and the duration between reminders. You can also set a timer - if the device user doesn't act on an update reminder before the timer times out, the update is automatically installed. #Network and Speed Download network - Select the network(s) in which devices in the campaign can download the update. If you choose to allow downloads in any network (Wi-Fi or mobile), you can additionally do the following: Allow firmware download while roaming. Set the campaign to switch to Wi-Fi/Ethernet when the firmware exceeds a certain size. If needed, you can also control the download speed. You can also set download speed limits for up to 5 specific SSIDs #Device Condition Specify how much battery life a device must have to start installing the update. You can also prevent an installation from starting on devices that are not connected a charging dock. #Factory Reset Specify whether you want to block end users from performing a factory reset on the device. #Support Contact Details Enter a phone number and email address end users can contact for support. You can also set these values as the default contact information for future campaigns. 4. Click Assign Devices. 5. From the device list, select one or more devices to assign to the test campaign. NOTE - You can't select a firmware version to apply when creating a test campaign. Instead, dummy firmware is applied by default. 6. Click Assign. 7. Click Create and Activate.

This feature was deprecated in API level 33 with Knox SDK v3.7. Protecting Data-At-Rest (DAR) on mobile devices is a major concern. While the industry standard is to encrypt all the data on a device, that data is decrypted and accessible after the device boots successfully. This access process means that once a device is lost or stolen, a sophisticated attack can extract data as long as the device is still running, even if the device is locked. Samsung created Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) to address this specific issue. SDP\"meets the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) requirements defined by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for DAR, meaning that SDP\"is approved for use by the US\"government and military. How SDP works KPE protects user data on the device through Data-at-Rest encryption. Data remains encrypted on disk, and can only be decrypted when the device is powered on. Recovery of data decryption keys is tied to: device hardware, meaning data is recoverable only on the same device, device boot-time integrity measurements, a user credential dependent on configuration Additionally, a mechanism is provided to optionally mark data as sensitive, which subsequently cannot be decrypted while the device is in the locked state. Here are the two protection modes that KPE provides for Data-at-Rest: Protected - All files stored on the device are treated as Protected by default. Protected data is stored on the device file system as encrypted data, and is only decrypted when an application accesses the data. This mechanism provides the data-at-rest protection while the device is powered off. Even if the device is in the lock state, applications can access protected data. Sensitive - Files can also be optionally marked as sensitive, using the Sensitive Data Protection (SDP) mechanism. SDP uses a key management scheme which ensures sensitive files can only be decrypted in the unlocked state, by purging keys from RAM when the device is locked. However, SDP also provides the ability for new files to be written and encrypted in the locked state using public key cryptography. SDP encryption Samsung Galaxy devices supporting Knox 3.3 and above are enabled to support Android\\'s File Based Encryption (FBE) for Data-at-Rest. Data encryption is enforced across the device using: EXT4 encryption FBE mechanism, FIPS compliant hardware crypto module (AES256-XTS) Optionally, the external SD Card can be used with: dm-crypt (introduced with Android 11) or eCryptfs stacked file system, FIPS compliant Kernel crypto module (AES256-CBC). FBE keys are derived using a password entry, which is either the default hard-coded password or the device user\\'s password used to unlock the device. While in the unlocked state, SDP works as follows: Encrypts sensitive data using a per-file File Encryption Key (FEK). These keys are encrypted with the SDPK.sym (Sensitive Data Protection Key, symmetric), which is encrypted by the SdpMasterKey. Keeps the SdpMasterKey in memory only while the device is unlocked, to allow decryption of the SDPK.sym and SDPK.pri (private). Encrypts the SdpMasterKey using the key that is protected by both ephemeral keys derived from the device user\\'s password and a key chaining to the Root Encryption Key (REK) using the Keystore. Clears the SdpMasterKey when it transitions to the locked state, and re-derives it when the user unlocks the device or Work container. While in the locked state, SDP handles apps writes of sensitive data differently: Rejects app attempts to open sensitive data files, as KPE no longer has the keys needed to retrieve sensitive data in memory and cannot re-derive them until the user unlocks the device or Work container. Encrypts any new sensitive app data by using both a: per-user sensitive data ECDH asymmetric key pair (SDPK.pri/pub) , per-file ECDH key pair [DataK.pri/pub] generated on behalf of the app, Protects the private portion of the ECDH key pair (SPDK', metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 123, 'title': 'Sensitive Data Protection (SDP)', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/fundamentals/whitepaper/core-platform-security/sensitive-data-protection', 'project': 'USP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None, 'id': '9365c8db-e1a9-4fc3-9e2f-273a357fce08'}), 0.5185484936461491)]\n",
