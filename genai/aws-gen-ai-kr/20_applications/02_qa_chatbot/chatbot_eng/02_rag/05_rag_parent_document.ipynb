      "[\"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard\"]\n",

To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard.

Use this guide to apply data access restrictions as needed based on your organization's application update, notification and URL requirements. Start tutorial About Knox Configure Knox Configure is available in separate editions: Setup edition Setup edition supports one-time configuration of enrolled devices and settings. To change a device configuration after initial policies are set, devices must be factory resettled and new policies must be re-applied. Setup edition includes a select subset of the policies and settings available in the Dynamic edition's normal mode. Dynamic edition Knox Configure Dynamic edition allows you to deploy and update enrolled device policies as many times as needed without a factory reset. Supported features include ProKiosk mode, Enterprise Billing, Knox Shared Devices and numerous other enhancements. Dynamic edition includes all the policies and settings available in the Setup edition, plus many more. Prerequisites Following prerequisites must be satisfied to use Knox Configure: Knox Configure portal doesn't support these special characters: \\\\# / $ \\\\* % ^ & \\\\\\\\ ( ) + ? [ ] Ensure they are not used when inputting characters into the portal. 1. Supported phones, tablets or wearable devices purchased from a participating reseller in the Knox Deployment Program. If you are not sure whether your reseller is participating in the program, contact the reseller or a Samsung Sales Representative for more information. 2. The appropriate Knox licenses purchased from a Knox Reseller (for commercial deployment). 3. A Knox account. For more information, see Sign up for Knox Configure. 4. The correct firewall exemptions needed to extend beyond your local and protected network domain and securely connect to the Knox Configure server. For more information, see Knox Configure firewall exceptions. 5. A supported browser (Edge, Firefox, or Chrome). The deployment process Using a web-based console, IT admins create profiles with the device settings, restrictions, apps, and other content to be deployed to groups of devices. After devices have been successfully enrolled in the enterprise, they receive device profiles via Wi-Fi or mobile data. This image below outlines the Knox Configure deployment process flow: Once a profile is configured, it can be assigned to specific Knox Configure managed devices. Device assignment is the final step in the configuration process, though devices can be locked by carriers and resellers post deployment. For more information, see Assign and deploy a profile to device. Device states Devices that are submitted to Knox Configure progress through the following states when assigned profiles and configurations are pushed to the device: For information on a selected device's unique device details and device log, see Device details and logs. Unassigned - The device is uploaded to Knox Configure, but there are no profiles yet assigned or a previously applied profile has been unassigned. Profile assigned - A profile was assigned to the device, but the device is yet to be configured. For example, the device may not have been powered on since a profile has been assigned\"]\n",
