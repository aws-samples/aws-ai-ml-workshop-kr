       " Document(page_content=\"Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 3, 'title': 'Overview', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/overview', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 3, 'title': 'Overview', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/overview', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\". When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 3, 'title': 'Overview', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/overview', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices', metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 3, 'title': 'Overview', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/overview', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26'}),\n",

In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license.

Then, click the gray box area on the Add Wallpaper Image screen. Margin Color - For devices that use a Kiosk background image, also known as a wallpaper, any space on the screen that does not have the wallpaper is filled with black or white color as selected. If the dimensions of your wallpaper image do not match the dimensions of your screen, you can choose to keep the original dimensions. Doing so creates margins around the wallpaper image. The margin color is determined by the settings you've selected for the Margin Color field. Keep Original Size - Check to use the original size of the image. Random Play - Check to show the registered wallpapers in random order. Screen Composition - You can add a status bar and logo on a customized Kiosk device\"]\n",
