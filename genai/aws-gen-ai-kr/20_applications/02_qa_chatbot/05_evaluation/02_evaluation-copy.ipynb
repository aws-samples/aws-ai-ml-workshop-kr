Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so. Refer to our detailed walkthrough of the account set up process for more information. Once you have an account, do the following: 1. Apply for access to Knox Suite. Refer to Apply for access to Knox Suite to learn more. 2. Once you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, navigate to the Licenses page to generate your Knox Capture license. Refer to the Manage other licenses section of the Knox Admin Portal's how-to guide for a detailed walkthrough. 3. Once you generate your Knox Suite license, use the key to activate your Knox Capture license. Activate your Knox Capture license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: For IT admins using Knox Capture, the license can be activated through the License menu in the app. To allow end-users to fully use Knox Capture app in managed mode, the license must be activated through your EMM. #Through the License menu There are two options for activating a license through the License menu. ##Option 1: Enter license key manually 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting for your Knox Capture license key. After you enter the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. ##Option 2: Enter license by scanning a QR code To use this method, you'll first need to have a valid Knox Suite license key converted into QR code format. Once you have a QR code generated: 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the QR code button. A scanning window appears. 3. Aim the camera at the QR code, then tap Done to activate the license. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for Knox Capture in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field 3. Save the configuration. View remaining scans If you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 15, 'title': 'Manage licenses', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/how-to-guides/manage-licenses', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-10-16', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None, 'id': 'e4400041-20f1-4866-8953-e875548d76fb'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan.

Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat. #By uninstalling the Knox Capture app To manually deactivate the license seat for a device, simply uninstall the Knox Capture app. The license agent then releases the associated seat for usage.\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 15, 'title': 'Manage licenses', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/how-to-guides/manage-licenses', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-10-16', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None, 'id': '9329c178-83e4-4ac0-aa3b-74c6e40e12c2'}),\n",

Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily. Barcodes inside bitmaps can now be scanned. Barcode image localization is improved in difficult scanning situations, depending on the device or symbologies involved.
