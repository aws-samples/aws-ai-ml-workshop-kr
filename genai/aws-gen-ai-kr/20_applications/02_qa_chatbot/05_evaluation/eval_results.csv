How does Knox E-FOTA enable enterprises to deploy OS updates remotely without requiring user interaction?,"Knox E-FOTA enables enterprise IT admins to remotely deploy OS versions and security updates to corporate devices without requiring user interaction. 

Admins can test updates before deployment to verify compatibility between in-house apps and new OS versions."," Knox E-FOTA enables enterprises to deploy OS updates remotely without requiring user interaction through the following features:

- Forced updates: Simplifies device management by allowing admins to deploy forced, silent updates that get installed on devices without requiring any user interaction. Users can't postpone or reject the updates.

- Scheduled updates: Allows admins to schedule firmware updates during non-business hours to avoid disruptions. Updates get installed on devices automatically per the schedule without needing any user input.

So in summary, Knox E-FOTA allows admins to schedule silent, forced updates that automatically get installed on devices on a defined schedule. This removes the need for any manual user interaction during the update process.",1,1,3,1.0,0.9999494552612305,1,0,7.512411832809448,"Knox E-FOTA.

Enable version control management, and deploy OS updates by setting updates to occur outside business hours to avoid disruptions to productivity. Start tutorial About Knox E-FOTA Knox E-FOTA""is an enterprise solution that controls OS versions on Samsung mobile devices to maximize cost efficiency. It helps IT admins do the following: Ensure that the latest security patches are deployed to devices on schedule. Test updates before deployment, ensuring compatibility between in-house apps and new OS versions. Key Features , Forced updates - Simplify your device management experience by deploying forced updates so that all devices have the same OS version on every device. You can push updates without requiring user interaction. Selective OS""version - The latest OS version isn't always compatible with your in-house apps. Ensure operational continuity by controlling which OS version to deploy to your devices. You can lock them to that version until you're ready to deploy the latest OS version. Scheduled updates - Minimize business interruptions by scheduling firmware updates to occur outside business hours. For a full list of all features, visit the product page for Knox E-FOTA. Benefits 1. Software compatibility testing - Only enforce updates once the software is tested to ensure compatibility between internal apps and new OS versions. This helps minimize the need for IT support for compatibility issues. 2. Device security - Deploy the latest verified firmware along with the latest security patches - also called Security Maintenance Releases (SMR) - to all corporate-liable devices immediately without requiring user interaction. 3. Efficient rollout - Maintain productivity by specifying a time when devices download and install updates to minimize business interruptions. IT admins can stagger the deployment of updates (for example, by region) to ensure operational continuity. 4. Efficient device management - Remotely deploying forced updates ensures that all enterprise devices are always running the latest validated OS version. Having a uniform view of all devices allows IT admins to manage them more efficiently. Silent updates do not require user interaction so they can't be postponed or rejected. How does Knox E-FOTA work? Firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) is a service that allows IT admins to efficiently and securely push firmware updates to a fleet of enterprise mobile devices. Typically, the latest firmware updates are pushed to devices by their service provider through a Samsung Business-To-Consumer (B2C) FOTA server. The problem with this is that the latest firmware isn't always compatible with a company's in-house apps. Without Knox E-FOTA, companies can only address this problem by doing the following: Always update to the latest OS version, Block all OS updates using their EMM Knox E-FOTA""allows admins to select a firmware version to deploy, even if it's not the latest version. Devices are then locked to that version. When admins have performed compatibility testing on a later firmware version, they can then update devices to the tested version. With Knox E-FOTA, businesses push firmware updates from a Samsung Business-To-Business (B2B) FOTA""server There are exceptions, such as AT&T and Verizon, which provide firmware updates from their own servers and not through Samsung's Knox E-FOTA service

The web portal 2. The client app 3. The organization's network infrastructure These three components interface to perform FOTA management in a containerized environment, isolated from the cloud. IT admins can sign in to the web portal to enroll devices, create campaigns, update policies, and schedule firmware downloads - all from the safety of an organization's in-house infrastructure.

. The B2B FOTA server then syncs the device information with the B2C FOTA server. #Downloading firmware versions Knox E-FOTA gives you access to a list of official firmware released via the general Samsung FOTA service within the last 12 months. An additional firmware list could be provided following an extra consultation. When pushing a firmware update, Samsung generates a delta file or a change file for updating from the current firmware version to a target version. This is then released via the general Samsung FOTA server and delivered to enterprise devices over-the-air. Firmware files are available from the Knox E-FOTA server for an average of 12 months. In some cases, especially when upgrading devices to a major Android OS version, you may be required to download several delta files to reach the target firmware version. On Knox E-FOTA""Advanced, this means you may need to run several campaigns incrementally to reach a target version. On Knox E-FOTA and""Knox E-FOTA""on MDM, only one campaign is needed; the required delta files are sequentially installed automatically. Regardless of which Knox E-FOTA edition you're using, this will result in devices rebooting multiple times. Compare the Knox E-FOTA editions There are three editions available for the Knox E-FOTA service: Knox E-FOTA, Knox E-FOTA""Advanced, Knox E-FOTA on MDM This section describes their key differentiating features.
