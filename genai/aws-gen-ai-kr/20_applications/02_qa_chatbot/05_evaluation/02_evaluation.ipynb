The following features were added in Knox E-FOTA to support Knox Suite features: The License details popup and the Licenses table now show the remaining number of seats in your license. For a Knox Suite license key, this number is calculated based on the number of seats consumed from all Knox services that use this license. When a device is enrolled in multiple Knox services under the same license key, that device only consumes 1 license seat. For example: License 1 has 30 seats , Device A and B are enrolled in Knox Manage under License 1 , Device B and C are enrolled in Knox E-FOTA under License 1 In this case, you'll see the following resulting values in the License details popup and the Licenses table: Purchased: 30 , Assigned: 2 - Because only two devices are enrolled in Knox E-FOTA , Remaining: 27 - Because three seats were actually consumed across all Knox services. Tooltips were also added in the License details popup and the Licenses table to provide guidance on Knox Suite license usage. A user can now have up to two trial licenses in Knox E-FOTA - one for Knox Suite and one for Knox E-FOTA. For more information on Knox Suite operations, see the Knox Suite Admin Guide. Knox E-FOTA client installation through managed Google Play #Through Knox Service Plugin You can now use the Knox Service Plugin (KSP) to remotely install the Knox E-FOTA client on your enterprise devices. Your EMM must be configured to use KSP. For more information, see Install the client app through KSP. The Knox E-FOTA app is now available in managed Google Play. If your EMM supports the following functionality through managed Google play, you can use managed Google Play to approve the Knox E-FOTA app, push the app to your devices, and launch the app on those devices. App installation (DO), Remote app launch Customizable postpone policy #Enhancements in the admin portal In order to give device users control over firmware updates, an enhancement was made in the postpone policy of new campaigns. When creating a campaign or a test campaign, you can now specify a postpone duration - the length of time it will take before the next firmware update reminder appears. You can also set a timer; if the user fails to act on an update reminder before the timer times out, the update is automatically installed. Previously, the postpone duration was fixed to 30 minutes and the timer was fixed to 30 seconds. A legacy campaign (that is, a campaign created before this release) will continue to have this postpone policy. However, when you edit a legacy campaign, you are presented with the customizable postpone settings. The new value ranges of the postpone settings are as follows: Postpone duration - 1 to 24 hours, Auto-install timer - 5 to 60 minutes #Enhancements in the client app The device now shows the remaining time in the timer (in seconds) before the firmware update begins. This allows the user to react (if needed) to postpone update. If they click Later, they see how long (in hours) before they'll be reminded again.

This app can be installed through the following: Out-of-box experience (OOBE) - This is applicable only to devices running Android P or later that were uploaded to Knox E-FOTA by a Knox reseller. Play Store or managed Google Play - If you have a mix of One UI and One UI Core devices, you can add both the Knox E-FOTA app and the Knox E-FOTA for One UI Core app to managed Google Play through your EMM console. Otherwise, you only need to add the proper app. Play Store or managed Google Play will install the appropriate app based on the type of device.

Previously, an IT admin that signed up for Knox Suite needed to be approved for each Knox service separately. In this release, the onboarding workflow for some of the Knox services was consolidated to expedite the approval process. This allows IT admins to get started immediately on using the Knox services. The following scenarios demonstrate three possible Knox Suite onboarding workflows: Scenario 1 - You are not registered in any Knox service and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment are always approved together. That is, if you're approved for access to one of these, you're automatically approved to use the other. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 2 - You are already registered in a Knox cloud service (Knox Mobile Enrollment, Knox E-FOTA, or Knox Configure) and you register for Knox Suite. 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You are automatically approved for access to Knox E-FOTA and Knox Mobile Enrollment. 3. If you're also approved for access to Knox Manage, a Knox Suite trial license key is generated and injected into your Knox Manage and Knox E-FOTA accounts. 4. You will receive emails confirming that your application was approved. Scenario 3 - You register for Knox Suite but are denied access to one of the Knox services 1. You will receive emails notifying you your application has been received. 2. You can still be approved for the other services that have not denied you access. Separate approval or rejection emails will be sent for the other services. 3. A Knox Suite trial license key is not generated. #Firmware notification emails Whenever a new firmware becomes available that is compatible to your registered devices, your Super Admins and Sub Admins, who have permission to manage the impacted devices, will receive an email notification\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 71, 'title': 'Knox E-FOTA 1.34 release notes', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/efota-one/release-notes/20-09', 'project': 'EFOTA', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None}),\n",

To apply a firmware update to devices, you must create a campaign and specify which firmware version will be pushed. You then assign devices to that campaign. When you activate the campaign, the firmware update is pushed to the assigned devices. Every 24 hours from the time the campaign is activated, the Knox E-FOTA client app on the assigned devices automatically polls the Knox E-FOTA server to check for any policy changes made to the campaign. Knox E-FOTA allows you to create two types of campaigns: Normal campaign - Allows you to assign production firmware to devices, Test campaign - Allows you to assign dummy firmware to devices This section describes how to create the different types of campaigns. For information on how a device behaves during a firmware update, see What happens to a device during a campaign?', metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 31, 'title': 'Introduction to campaigns', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/efota-one/features/create-a-campaign/campaign-intro', 'project': 'EFOTA', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\". The client app (that is, the agent on the device) periodically checks the policy and applies any campaign updates that may not have been successfully applied to it. Device registration through Knox Deployment Program (KDP) ✔ Resellers can automatically upload your devices to Knox E-FOTA so that you don't have to add them yourself. You can auto-approve their uploads and auto-assign the devices to a default campaign. This feature is only available through KDP. Out-of-box installation of Knox E-FOTA client app ✔ For devices purchased through a reseller that have Android P or later, the client app is automatically installed during the out-of-box experience. Support for multiple licenses ✔ Add licenses as needed to support more devices, while keeping existing licenses active. Consolidated admin access ✔ Sign in to SamsungKnox.com once and gain access to all Knox Cloud Services (KCS) products you're subscribed to. Consistent user experience ✔ The Knox E-FOTA admin portal has a user interface that's consistent with other KCS products on SamsungKnox.com.\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 2, 'title': 'Knox E-FOTA', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/efota-one', 'project': 'EFOTA', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Knox E-FOTA 1.38 release notes. Release notes for Knox E-FOTA 1.38 Privacy Policy UX improvement Now, new end users can see the improved Privacy Policy UX based on your country in order to comply with privacy regulations. Existing end users don't need to re-agree with the Privacy Policy. Web console and device app now show more device details The Knox E-FOTA web console > Devices screen has replaced the Device Status with more detailed information: Operation status: Describes the status of the device licensing and campaign sync. Campaign status: Describes the status of an assigned campaign. Client status: Describes the status of the Knox E-FOTA client app on the device. Update status: Describes the status of a firmware update, information that is now also included in the Device Update Status dashboard and Campaign Graph. Other related new features: For details about the new statuses, you can hover over the status to pop up a tooltip description in the Device Update Status dashboard. You can now see the total number of devices to be updated and the number that have completed their updates so far. The Knox E-FOTA app on the device now shows the Client status, which is synchronized with the web console. Previously, the web console and device showed different status information. Synchronize device groups from multiple EMM instances Previously, you could re-use device groups defined in a single EMM instance. Now, you can connect to up to five different EMM instances, which can be of the same EMM vendor (for example, multiple on-prem servers) or different EMM vendors. The Knox E-FOTA web console identifies the different EMM instances, which you can selectively synchronize groups with, desynchronize groups with, or remove entirely. Synchronize Organization type groups from Knox Manage As you might know, you can use device groups configured in your EMM to deploy Knox E-FOTA firmware updates by predefined groups. To learn more about this feature, see Managing EMM groups and Add device groups from Knox Manage. Previously, you could re-use only User, Device, and AD/LDAP based groups from Knox Manage. Now, you can also re-use Organization groups to enable Knox E-FOTA updates for all devices. Seamless integration with Managed Service Providers (MSPs) An MSP can use the Knox Managed Service Provider program to onboard multiple Knox customers, manage their Knox services, and deploy services onto their devices. Previously, MSPs could manage only the Knox Configure and Knox Mobile Enrollment services on behalf of customers. With this KCS 1.38 release, MSPs can now also manage Knox E-FOTA. Specifically, MSPs can: Onboard new Knox E-FOTA customers on the MSP portal. Migrate existing Knox E-FOTA customers to the MSP program. Upgrade existing MSP customers to include the Knox E-FOTA service. Manage Knox E-FOTA services on behalf of customers, including Knox E-FOTA Administrator functions. Check the customer status, which can be Pending (customer hasn't yet approved or rejected Knox E-FOTA management), Active (customer has consented), Rejected (customer has not consented). Give customers view access to the Knox E-FOTA console to monitor setup. Browse a log of MSP activities related to the Knox E-FOTA services. Delink Knox E-FOTA from a managed customer's Knox services. Subscribe to Knox E-FOTA emails. Both the MSP and managed customer can get emails about adding and migrating customers, changing customer access levels, and removing a customer service. SSO with Microsoft Azure Active Directory As you might know, the Knox cloud services support Single Sign On with MS Azure AD, in addition to sign on with a Samsung Account. Previously, only Knox Configure and Knox Mobile Enrollment supported AD SSO. With the KCS 1.38 release, Knox E-FOTA also supports AD SSO. For info about how to set up AD SSO, see Sign in with Azure AD.
