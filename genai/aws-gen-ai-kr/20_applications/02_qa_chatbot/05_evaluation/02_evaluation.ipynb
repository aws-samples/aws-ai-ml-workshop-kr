So end-users with those device models cannot use Knox Capture features.\\n\\n2) To access Knox Capture\\'s Bluetooth output to PC functionality, the end-user would need access to a separate Bluetooth-enabled PC or device to connect to (see paragraph under \"Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth\"). So there is a dependency on additional hardware to utilize that feature fully.\\n\\n3) For the double press side key trigger option, that is only applicable for devices without a dedicated XCover scan trigger hardware key (see paragraph under \"Added side key double press scan trigger\").

       " 'source_documents': [Document(page_content=\"Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue.

New features Knox Capture v1.9 introduces the following new features: #Support for AR demo mode You can now test the Knox Capture AR feature without having to set up a real server or go through any profile creation or setup process. To learn more about this new feature, please see the Demo AR guide. #On-screen suggestions for increasing scanning success rate To help increase the success rate of barcode scans, Knox Capture now provides suggestions on-screen to tell end-users when their device is either too far from a barcode, or at an angle in which the barcode cannot be easily read. #Ability to turn on flashlight by default You can now choose from three different flashlight options (Off/On/Automatic) in the scan engine settings, making it easier for device users to work in all lighting conditions. To learn about these flashlight options, see Configure scan engine settings. Knox Capture: Scandit Edition only supports On and Off as flashlight options. #Official support for inverted-color recognition on all barcode types In Knox Capture v1.8, we introduced inverse color recognition for DataMatrix and QR barcode types. In this release, your users can now scan inverted-color barcodes on all available barcode types. To learn how to use this feature, see Configure scan engine settings. #Support for QR code license scanning To help speed up the license activation workflow for end-users, you can now generate a Knox Suite license as a QR code, then have end-users scan that QR code to automatically enter the license key in their app. Knox Capture does not generate a QR code for you. #Knox Capture SDK v1.1.0 This release of Knox Capture v1.9 also introduces a new version of the Knox Capture SDK for customers who wish to develop their own custom scanning applications. SDK v1.1.0 introduces a new mini scanner API and adds support for inverse color barcode recognition on all available barcode types. To learn more the Knox Capture SDK, see our developer documentation. Enhancements This release introduces the following feature enhancements: #Updated UI for Aim and scan feature When using the Aim and scan feature, users will now see a distinct blue line when a barcode is detected, and a white line when the barcode is not detected. Previously, users would see a white line before and after barcode detection. #Improved support menu In the app's support menu, you can now tap a button to quickly contact a Knox sales representative.

       "  Document(page_content=\"Manage licenses. Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so. Refer to our detailed walkthrough of the account set up process for more information. Once you have an account, do the following: 1. Apply for access to Knox Suite. Refer to Apply for access to Knox Suite to learn more. 2. Once you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, navigate to the Licenses page to generate your Knox Capture license. Refer to the Manage other licenses section of the Knox Admin Portal's how-to guide for a detailed walkthrough. 3. Once you generate your Knox Suite license, use the key to activate your Knox Capture license. Activate your Knox Capture license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: For IT admins using Knox Capture, the license can be activated through the License menu in the app. To allow end-users to fully use Knox Capture app in managed mode, the license must be activated through your EMM. #Through the License menu There are two options for activating a license through the License menu. ##Option 1: Enter license key manually 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting for your Knox Capture license key. After you enter the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. ##Option 2: Enter license by scanning a QR code To use this method, you'll first need to have a valid Knox Suite license key converted into QR code format. Once you have a QR code generated: 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the QR code button. A scanning window appears. 3. Aim the camera at the QR code, then tap Done to activate the license. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for Knox Capture in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field 3. Save the configuration. View remaining scans If you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 15, 'title': 'Manage licenses', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/how-to-guides/manage-licenses', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-10-16', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied\", metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 6, 'title': 'Admin get started', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/get-started/admin-tutorial', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the \"Android - Secured by Knox\" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device\\'s default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes', metadata={'source': 'all_processed_data.json', 'seq_num': 31, 'title': 'Knox Capture v1.4 release notes', 'url': 'https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/knox-capture/release-notes/v1-4', 'project': 'KCAP', 'last_updated': '2023-07-26', 'family_tree': 'parent', 'parent_id': None})]}"

      "\u001b[32mGroundTruth: \u001b[0m \u001b[32mIn managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is limited, as end-users cannot make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or activate a Knox Capture license to switch to Admin mode.\u001b[0m\n",
      "\u001b[34mPrediction: \u001b[0m \u001b[34m It is based on the following paragraphs from the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following:\n",
      "1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.).  \n",
      "2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes.\n",
      "3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key differences between Knox Capture in Admin mode versus Managed mode are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Admin mode:\n",
      "- Can create, edit, test scanning profiles  \n",
      "- Can export configuration settings\n",
      "- Full app functionality \n",
      "\n",
      "Managed mode:  \n",
      "- Can only view and use existing scanning profiles, cannot edit them\n",
      "- Cannot export configuration settings\n",
      "- Limited app functionality focused on scanning only\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, Admin mode enables full configuration capabilities while Managed mode locks down the configuration and limits the app to primarily barcode scanning functionality.\u001b[0m\n",
