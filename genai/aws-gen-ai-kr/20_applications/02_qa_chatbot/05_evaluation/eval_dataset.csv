How does Knox E-FOTA allow IT admins to securely push updates to enterprise mobile devices while maintaining compatibility with in-house apps?,"Unfortunately I could not find the answer to this specific question in the given context. The context discusses some benefits of efficient rollout and device management with Knox, as well as an overview of firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates in general. However, it does not clearly state how Knox E-FOTA allows IT admins to securely push updates while maintaining compatibility with in-house apps.",52ef29a7-fc80-433a-92a1-88969b5e781d,". 3.

Efficient device management - Remotely deploying forced updates ensures that all enterprise devices are always running the latest validated OS version. Having a uniform view of all devices allows IT admins to manage them more efficiently. Silent updates do not require user interaction so they can't be postponed or rejected. How does Knox E-FOTA work? Firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) is a service that allows IT admins to efficiently and securely push firmware updates to a fleet of enterprise mobile devices. Typically, the latest firmware updates are pushed to devices by their service provider through a Samsung Business-To-Consumer (B2C) FOTA server.

What happens to the default campaign assignment when you sync existing devices from an EMM group again after already syncing them once before?,Could not find answer in given contexts.,d4321240-167e-467d-9c55-d9aab9641fdc,". When you assign a campaign to an EMM device group, this campaign is automatically set as the default campaign for the group. This default campaign is assigned only to devices in the group when they are synced from the EMM for the first time. After the first sync, existing devices synced from EMM groups won't be assigned the default campaign when you sync from the EMM again.

On the EMM groups page: Click Actions > Manage group priority, or , Click Manage all group priority. 2. Click one or more groups and reassign their priority using the upward or downward arrow. 3"
Why does Device A retain its Assigned status after Group 2 is enrolled and assigned to Campaign B?,"Device A retains its Assigned status after Group 2 is enrolled and assigned to Campaign B because Group 1, which Device A belongs to, has a higher priority than Group 2. So Device A follows the policy of Group 1 rather than Group 2.",2ee63b01-5ea7-411e-a8d7-3d7b5729ae11,". Device A, however, will retain its Assigned status (following the first policy above).
