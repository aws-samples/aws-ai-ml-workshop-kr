END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (EULA)
for NICE Software and Solutions
(Version 8.4) 

This End User License Agreement ("EULA" or "Agreement") contains the terms
and conditions that govern your ("Licensee" or "you" or "your") access to and
use of NICE EnginFrame and Amazon DCV (together with any updates, including
updates to the software name, or enhancements, and accompanying documentation,
"Software") and Amazon DCV Web Client software development kit (together with
any updates, including any updates to the software development kit name, or
enhancements, and accompanying documentation,"SDK"). As used in this EULA,
"NICE" means NICE, S.r.l. with principal offices located at Via Milliavacca, 9
– 14100 Asti - Italy ("NICE IT"), except that if Licensee is located in the
United States, "NICE" means NICE USA LLC, with principal offices at 410 Terry
Avenue North, Seattle, Washington, 98109-5210 ("NICE US"). This EULA 
supplements the AWS Customer Agreement posted at aws.amazon.com/agreement or
other agreement with NICE or an affiliate governing your use of NICE services 
(the "Customer Agreement"), and unless otherwise defined in this EULA, 
capitalized terms will have the same meaning as set forth in the Customer 
Agreement.  

1. LICENSE TO AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE. The Software may be accessed and used
only in accordance with this EULA and the Customer Agreement, and subject to
these terms: (a) You are granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable,
non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software for your internal
business purposes only and only in the quantity that you have purchased from
NICE or an authorized reseller of the Software, or to the extent your use has
otherwise been authorized by NICE or Amazon Web Services. (b) if you requested
access to the Software to evaluate its features and functionality, you are
granted a limited, non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable license to
install and use the Software for your internal evaluation and testing purposes
only, and only in the quantity that you have requested from NICE.  

2. BETA PARTICIPATION. NICE may provide Licensee certain features, 
technologies, software, and services that are not yet generally available,
including those labeled "beta", "preview", "pre-release", or "experimental"
(each, a "Beta"). Access and use of Betas are subject to any Beta terms
provided by NICE and if there is a conflict between the terms of this Section
and any Beta terms, Beta terms will take precedence. Betas are Software subject
to all the terms and conditions of this EULA. (a) Licensee agrees not to allow
access to or use of any Beta or any related materials by any third party other
than Licensee's employees and contractors who have a need to use or access in
connection with Licensee's internal evaluation activities and have executed
written non-disclosure agreements obligating them to protect the 
confidentiality of the Beta and related materials. (b) Licensee must comply
with all policies and guidelines related to any Beta as posted on the NICE's
website or otherwise made available to Licensee. NICE may add or modify
restrictions, including usage limits related to access to or use of any Beta
or related materials at any time. If requested by NICE, Licensee will promptly
increase or decrease usage to the levels that NICE may specify. Any service
level agreements that Licensee may have for the Software do not apply to Betas.
(c) Licensee will, when requested by NICE, provide NICE with information
relating to Licensee's access, use, testing, and evaluation of the Beta and any
related Beta Materials, including observations or information regarding the
performance, features, and functionality of the Beta in the form reasonably
requested by NICE ("Test Observations"). NICE will own and may use and evaluate
all Test Observations for its own purposes. All Betas, related materials, and
Test Observations are NICE Confidential Information. Each individual Beta
license will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available
version of the Beta or upon notice of termination by NICE which may occur at
any time and for any reason. Upon the termination of Licensee's license to any
Beta, Licensee will cease use of the Beta and immediately return or, if
instructed by NICE, destroy all copies of the Beta and all related materials.
NICE does not guarantee that any Beta will ever be made generally available or
that any generally available version will contain the same or similar
functionality as any Beta version made available to Licensee. (d) WITHOUT
LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS HEREIN, BETAS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL
RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS EULA OR
OTHERWISE, NICE PROVIDES BETAS TO LICENSEE "AS IS." 

 3. USE RESTRICTIONS. Your use of the Software is conditioned upon your
 compliance with the following limitations: 
(a) Licensee will not distribute, rent, lease, lend, loan, transfer, assign,
resell, sublicense, disclose, or otherwise provide the Software to or use the
Software for the benefit of any third party (including acting as a service
bureau or provide of a time sharing service). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Licensee may permit its third party contractors to use the software for
Licensee's internal business purposes provided that Licensee enters to a
binding agreement with contractor requiring contractor to comply with this
EULA and is solely responsible and liable for any breach of this EULA
including any unauthorized use of the Software by Licensee's contractors.
(b) Licensee will not modify, adapt, translate, alter, tamper with, repair,
or otherwise create derivative works of the Software, subject to Section 10. 
(c) Licensee will not decompile, decipher, disassemble, reverse engineer or
otherwise attempt to access or derive source code of the Software, except to
the extent applicable law does not allow this restriction. 
(d) Licensee will not attempt to use the Software in excess of any usage limits
and will not attempt to circumvent any technology in or with the Software that
is designed to monitor, restrict, or limit use. Licensee acknowledges and 
agrees that the Software (including all evaluation versions) may require the
use of license key or token in order to operate and that operation of the
Software will automatically terminate upon expiration. 
(e) Licensee will not remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Software
or any copy thereof. 
(f) Licensee requires that each end user before accessing the Software, agrees
to comply with this EULA.

(b) Licensee has no obligation to give NICE any suggestions, comments, or other
feedback relating to the Software ("Feedback"). To the extent Licensee provides
Feedback to NICE, NICE may use and exercise any and all rights in the Feedback
without obligation or restriction of any kind during and after the Term, and
Feedback will not be deemed to be confidential information of Licensee or
otherwise create any confidentiality obligation. Licensee agrees not to provide
any Feedback that: (i) Licensee knows is subject to any patent, copyright or
other intellectual property claim or right of any third party; or (ii) is
subject to license terms which seek to require any products incorporating or
derived from the Feedback, or other NICE intellectual property, to be licensed
to or otherwise shared with any third party.  

5. AUDIT. Licensee shall maintain accurate records regarding Licensee's use
of the Software and compliance with this EULA and, upon request, make such
records available to NICE and certify Licensee's compliance with this EULA.
NICE or a third party may examine and audit Licensee's access, use, and
deployment of the Software and verify Licensee's compliance with this EULA.
Any audit will take place during normal business hours on at least 10 days
prior written notice. If Licensee misreported any figure or underpaid any
amount, Licensee will remit to NICE the amount of any underpayment within 10
days after notification of the discrepancy. If the discrepancy exceeds $1,000
U.S. dollars or 5% of the total amount purchased or reported by Licensee for
the period audited, then Licensee will reimburse NICE for the reasonable costs
of the audit.  

6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Licensee may be eligible to subscribe to software support
for any or all of the Software (the "Support Services", as described and
regulated under the Standard Support Services for NICE Products terms,
available here:
https://www.nice-software.com/html/pdf/NICE_Standard_Support_Services.pdf , as
may be updated). Support Services are subject to and governed by the terms of
this EULA and the Customer Agreement, as is any update or upgrade to the
Software provided by NICE in connection with Support Services. If the Support
Services are terminated, Licensee's license to the Software under this EULA
will continue in accordance with the terms of this EULA. If Support Services
expire or terminate and Licensee later reinstates Support Services, Licensee
shall pay a reinstatement fee equal to 70% of the current annual charge for
Support Services for the period of time when Licensee did not receive Support
Services. The reinstatement fee for any partial year will be a pro rata portion
of the applicable annual fee.  

7. LIMITED WARRANTY. 
(a) NICE warrants that the Software will for a period of 60 days from delivery
to the Licensee (the "Warranty Period"), when used in accordance with NICE's
written instructions, operate substantially in compliance with NICE's official
published documentation. NICE's sole responsibility, and Licensee's exclusive
remedy, in the event of breach of the limited warranty during the Warranty 
Period, is for NICE, at its option, to use reasonable efforts to repair the 
Software, replace the Software, or provide a refund. NICE shall not be
responsible or liable for any noncompliance with the foregoing warranty or
limitations or defects of the Software, if they have been caused, in whole or
in part, by unauthorized behavior of Licensee, any use of the Software which is
inconsistent with the Documentation, any accident, abuse, or misapplication,
and/or if they arise from or are related to software or any other products
which are not supplied by NICE.

11. GENERAL.
(a) Entire Agreement. This EULA and its incorporation of the Customer 
Agreement, along with related documents provided by NICE, represents the
complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, and
understandings. NICE will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any
term, condition or other provision that is different from or in addition to the
provisions of this EULA (whether or not it would materially alter this EULA)
including for example, any term, condition or other provision (i) submitted by
Licensee in any purchase order, receipt, acceptance, confirmation,
correspondence or other document, or (ii) related to any invoicing process that
Licensee submits or require NICE to complete. To the extent there is any
conflict between this EULA and the Customer Agreement, this EULA prevails.
(b) Assignment. Licensee shall not assign or otherwise transfer this EULA or
any of Licensee's rights or obligations, without our prior written consent.
Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be void. NICE may
assign this EULA without your consent (i) in connection with a merger,
acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (ii) to any
affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such
assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for NICE as a party to this EULA
and NICE is fully released from all of its obligations and duties to perform
under this EULA. Subject to the foregoing, this EULA will be binding upon, and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns.
(c) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution for US Licensees. If NICE US is the
contracting party to this EULA, the laws of the State of Washington, without
reference to conflict of law rules, govern this EULA and any dispute of any
sort that might arise between NICE and Licensee. The United Nations Convention
for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this EULA. Any dispute or
claim relating in any way to the Software or this EULA will be adjudicated
exclusively in the federal and state courts located in King County, Washington,
and Licensee consents and waives any objections to such exclusive jurisdiction 
and venue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NICE may seek injunctive (or similar)
remedies in any jurisdiction. 
(d) Governing Law and Dispute Resolution when Licensees Outside the US. (i) If
NICE IT is the contracting party to this EULA, the laws of the Republic of
Italy, without reference to conflict of law rules, govern this EULA and any
dispute of any sort that might arise between NICE and Licensee. The United
Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this
EULA. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to the Software or this EULA
will be adjudicated exclusively in the Court of Milan, Italy, and Licensee
consents and waives any objections to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, NICE may seek injunctive (or similar) remedies
in any jurisdiction. (ii) IF NICE IT IS THE CONTRACTING PARTY, PURSUANT TO AND
BY THE EFFECT OF SECTIONS 1341 AND 1342 OF THE ITALIAN CIVIL CODE, LICENSEE
EXPLICITLY APPROVES THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: 3 (USE RESTRICTIONS), 7 (LIMITED
WARRANTY), 8 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY), 9 (TERMINATION), 10 (GENERAL -
INCLUDING GOVERNING LAW, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, CONFIDENTIALITY AND PUBLICITY,
AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE AGREEMENT).
(e) Waiver. The failure by NICE to enforce any provision of this EULA will not
constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor will it limit
NICE's right to enforce such provision at a later time. All waivers by NICE
must be in writing to be effective.
(f) Severability. If any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to
effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not
possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from this
Agreement but the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
(g) Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law,
for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges
(and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on
that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this
EULA. All fees payable by Licensee are exclusive of applicable taxes and
duties, including VAT, Service Tax, GST, excise taxes, sales and transactions
taxes, and gross receipts tax ("Indirect Taxes"). NICE may charge and Licensee
will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that NICE is legally obligated or authorized
to collect from Licensee. Licensee will provide such information to NICE as
reasonably required to determine whether NICE is obligated to collect Indirect
Taxes from Licensee. NICE will not collect, and Licensee will not pay, any
Indirect Tax for which Licensee furnishes NICE a properly completed exemption
certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which NICE may claim an
available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by Licensee to
NICE under this EULA will be made free and clear of any deduction or
withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding
(including cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment,
Licensee will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net
amount received by NICE is equal to the amount then due and payable under this
EULA. NICE will provide Licensee with such tax forms as are reasonably
requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or
deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this EULA.
(h) Confidentiality And Publicity. Licensee may use NICE Confidential
Information only in connection with Licensee's use of the Software as
permitted under this EULA. Licensee will not disclose NICE Confidential
Information during the Term or at any time after without NICE's advance written
consent. Licensee will take all reasonable measures to avoid disclosure,
dissemination, or unauthorized use of NICE Confidential Information, including,
at a minimum, those measures Licensee takes to protect its own confidential
information of a similar nature. Licensee will not issue any press release or
make any other public communication with respect to this EULA or your use of
the Software. "NICE Confidential Information" means all nonpublic information
disclosed by NICE its affiliates, business partners or its or their respective
employees, contractors or agents that is designated as confidential or that,
given the nature of the information or circumstances surrounding its
disclosure, reasonably should be understood to be confidential. NICE
Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or
becomes publicly available without breach of this EULA; (ii) can be shown by
documentation to have been known to Licensee at the time of receipt from NICE;
(iii) is received from a third party who did not acquire or disclose the same
by a wrongful or tortious act; or (iv) can be shown by documentation to have
been independently developed by Licensee without reference to NICE
Confidential Information.
(i) Notices. Any notice required or permitted by this EULA to be given to
either party shall be effective upon receipt and shall be given in writing and
sent by overnight courier, facsimile, or first class certified mail with
postage prepaid. Notices to Licensee will be sent to the addresses indicated
in the applicable order for the Software and to the NICE contracting party at
the address in the opening paragraph of this EULA. Receipt shall be presumed
received 5 business days after mailing by first class mail unless the sender
obtains a delivery receipt indicating it was delivered earlier, the next day
if sent by over-night courier, and when confirmation is received if by fax.
In addition, a copy of the notice shall also be given via e-mail to each
party's primary contact. Either party may designate a different address than
that given below by notice to the other party in accordance with this
paragraph. A copy of any notice required or permitted to be sent to NICE shall
also be sent to Amazon.com, Inc. Attn: General Counsel P.O. Box 81226 Seattle,
WA 98108-1226 Fax: (206) 266-7010 E-mail: contracts-legal@amazon.com.
(j) Modifications To The Agreement. NICE may modify this EULA at any time by
posting a revised version on the NICE website (nice-software.com, and any
successor or related site designated by NICE, hereinafter, the "NICE Website")
or by sending a message to the email address then associated with Licensee's
account. Notices of modifications NICE provides by posting on the NICE Website
will be effective upon posting, and notices NICE provides by email will be
effective when NICE sends the email. It is Licensee's responsibility to keep
its email address current. Licensee will be deemed to have received any email
sent to the email address then associated with its account when NICE sends the
email, whether or not Licensee actually receives the email. By continuing to
use the Software after the effective date of any modifications to this EULA,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the modified terms. It is Licensee's
responsibility to check the NICE Website regularly for modifications to this
EULA.
(k) Trade Compliance. In connection with this EULA, Licensee will comply with
all applicable import, re-import, sanctions, anti-boycott, export, and
re-export control laws and regulations, including all such laws and regulations
that apply to a U.S. company, such as the Export Administration Regulations,
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions programs
implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. For clarity, Licensee is
solely responsible for compliance related to the manner in which Licensee
chooses to use the Software. Licensee represents and warrants that Licensee and
its financial institutions, or any party that owns or controls Licensee or its
financial institutions, are not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on
any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the lists maintained by
the United Nations Security Council, the US Government (e.g., the US Department
of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders
list and the US Department of Commerce's Entity List), the European Union or
its member states, or other applicable government authority.
(l) U.S. Government Rights. The Software is provided to the U.S. Government as
"commercial items," "commercial computer software," "commercial computer
software documentation," and "technical data" with the same rights and
restrictions generally applicable to the Software. If you are using the
Software on behalf of the U.S. Government and these terms fail to meet the U.S.
Government's needs or are inconsistent in any respect with federal law,
Licensee will immediately discontinue use of the Software. The terms
"commercial item" "commercial computer software," "commercial computer software
documentation," and "technical data" are defined in the Federal Acquisition
Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.
(m) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This EULA does not create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this
EULA.
